Abstract = {Service regularity is one of the most significant performance indicators
   for public transport routes, typically measured through headway
   adherence. When headway deviations become too large and corresponding
   headways very small, bus bunching typically occurs. In these cases,
   passengers experience larger waiting times and overcrowding and an
   overall poor level of service. This paper aims to gain insight on
   frequent patterns of bus bunching using spatial analytics. Local and
   global spatial autocorrelation tests are performed on real world
   Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data to investigate spatial structures
   in the data. The spatio-temporal variations of bus bunching patterns
   throughout the day are further modeled using the ST-DBSCAN algorithm.
   Results show that the last few stops of each route exhibit statistically
   significant spatial autocorrelation with respect to the frequency of
   bunching, while the duration of bunching events is longer for route
   segments located in the central business district. Spatio-temporal
   clustering indicates that bunching is observed at a higher number of
   stops during peak traffic periods.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching often occurs in public transit system, re-sulting in a
   series of problems such as poor punctuality, long waiting time and low
   service quality. In this paper, we explore the influence of the
   dis-crete distribution of traffic operation state on the dynamic
   evolution of bus bunching. Firstly, we use self-organizing map (SOM) to
   find the threshold of bus bunching and analyze the factors that affect
   bus bunching based on GPS data of No. 600 bus line in Xi'an. Then,
   taking the bus headway as the research index, we construct the bus
   bunching mechanism model. Finally, a simulation platform is built by
   MATLAB to examine the trend of headway when various influencing factors
   show different distribution states along the bus line. In terms of
   influencing factors, inter vehicle speed, queuing time at intersection
   and loading time at station are shown to have a sig-nificant impact on
   headway between buses. In terms of the impact of the distribution of
   crowded road sections on headway, long-distance and con-centrated
   crowded road sections will lead to large interval or bus bunching. When
   the traffic states along the bus line are randomly distributed among
   crowded, normal and free, the headway may fluctuate in a large range,
   which may result in bus bunching, or fluctuate in a small range and
   remain relatively stable. The headway change curve is determined by the
   distri-bution length of each traffic state along the bus line. The
   research results can help to formulate improvement measures according to
   traffic operation state for equilibrium bus headway and alleviating bus
   bunching.},

Title = {Interfering Spatiotemporal Features and Causes of Bus Bunching using
   Empirical GPS Trajectory Data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Bus bunching refers to the phenomenon that several buses arrive at a
   station within a short period. It dramatically increases passengers'
   waiting time and reduces the quality of transit service. Evaluating the
   features of bus bunching and identifying the causes are important to
   developing countermeasures. The primary of this study was to analyze the
   temporal-spatial features of bus bunching by conducting an in-depth
   analysis of empirical bus GPS trajectory data obtained in Nanjing,
   China. The GPS data were inputted into the ArcGIS to track the spatial
   map's bus trajectories. A data processing procedure was proposed to
   analyze the data, including data cleaning, trip cutting, each station's
   arrival and departure time estimation, and time headway calculation.
   Then the spatiotemporal trajectory picture was drawn for the bus route
   where the bus bunching was identified. The study also analyzed the
   headway features of consecutive buses at the different stations and
   evaluated the variation of time headway, indicating the severity of bus
   bunching. The results showed that there are significant differences in
   the spatiotemporal features of bus bunching between bus stations. When
   the bus bunching occurred, it persisted on downstream stations for a
   long time. The bunching severity dramatically increased at downstream
   stations, reducing bus arrival reliability on the whole bus line. We
   also identified that the bus bunching was primarily caused by the
   overlong bus dwelling time at a station and the different travel times
   of buses between stations. The study fills the gap by developing the
   methodology to investigate the bus bunching features and causes with
   point-by-point empirical GPS trajectory data. Findings of the study can
   also support the real-time prediction and warning of bus bunching in
   practical applications.},

   Under the premise of the widely used smart card, the research takes a
   single bus line as the object and studies it with the historical data of
   the smart card. A real-time model of passengers waiting at bus stops is
   established based on the data of bus speed and historical data.
   Moreover, the prediction result is used to predict the bus bunching.
   This paper will verify the efficiency and feasibility of the model by
   numerical examples. The study's results show that the prediction model
   of bus bunching based on smart card data can predict the condition
   during bus operation accurately and discover potential problems in time.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching is a well-known phenomenon for operators, users and
   regulators of high-frequency bus services. Bus operations are usually
   affected by increasing differences in the time intervals (headways)
   between consecutive buses. The effect of this variability is that buses
   tend to group into bunches of two or more, which severely affects the
   quality of service and the operational efficiency. The aim of this paper
   is to analyze which factors are associated to the phenomenon, using
   massive data from high-frequency services available in Santiago (Chile)
   and common-route services in Gatineau (Canada). The data is obtained
   from the bus GPS and AFC systems and are processed to obtain headways
   between buses. Using data from one week, we develop models to explain
   the variation of the continuous and discrete indicators of bus bunching
   as a function of variables related to the operation, variables related
   to the demand structure, and variables related to the infrastructure.
   Some of the factors that contribute to increase bus bunching are: stops
   located toward the end of the route, high scheduled frequency, irregular
   bus dispatch headways, non-homogeneous fleet, high demand, and high
   variability of demand. The results are useful for the design of quality
   indexes to measure bunching in bus operations, and for the design and
   operation of bus routes, taking into consideration the potential bus
   bunching problems.},

Abstract = {Busy bus routes often suffer from buses not arriving at regular
   intervals but in bunches at bus stops. In this paper we study this bus
   bunching phenomenon and address it by a combination of data-driven
   headway prediction and dynamic holding strategies, which allow to
   modulate buses' dwell times at stops to reduce the headway deviation. We
   formulate time headways as time series and compare several prediction
   methods by testing on data from a busy bus route in Dublin. Furthermore
   we review and extend an analytical model of an artificial bus route and
   discuss stability properties and dynamic holding strategies using both
   data available at the time and predicted headway data. In a numerical
   simulation we illustrate how the combination of two simple concepts lead
   to a promising strategy to reduce bus bunching. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Travel delays and bus overcrowding are some of the daily
   dissatisfactions of public transportation users. These problems may be
   caused by bus bunching, an event that occurs when two or more buses are
   running the same route together, i.e. out of schedule. Due to the
   stochastic nature of the traffic, a static schedule is not effective to
   avoid the occurrence of these events; thus, preventive actions are
   necessary to improve the reliability of the public transportation
   system. In this context, we propose a decision tree ensemble model to
   predict bus bunching. We use an ensemble of Random Forest, eXtreme
   Gradient Boosting and Categorical Boosting models applied to Global
   Positioning System, General Transit Feed Specification, weather and
   traffic situation data. The efficacy of the proposed model has been
   demonstrated using real data sets and has been compared with four
   baselines: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector
   Machine and Relevance Vector Machine. According to the results, the
   proposed model can achieve an efficacy between 74 and 80\% and can be
   used to predict bus bunching in real time up to 10 stops before its
   occurrence.},

Abstract = {Some stops on busy bus lines regularly suffer from bus bunching, which
   refers to a bus arriving with a little headway to its predecessor. This
   phenomenon increases scheduling difficulties and has a negative impact
   on the passenger experience due to unreasonable scheduling. The
   conventional holding strategy aims to alleviate this problem by holding
   buses at control points. However, the holding strategy has the drawbacks
   of creating large deviations from the original schedule and prolonging
   passenger waiting time when confronted with traffic congestion. This
   study proposes an innovative short-turning strategy to alleviate bus
   bunching by the deliberate conversion of a few regular trips to
   short-turning trips. A nonlinear optimisation model is developed by
   rescheduling a set of trips using the short-turning strategy to minimise
   schedule deviation from the original schedule. The nonlinear
   short-turning model is then converted into a linear form that is
   solvable by CPLEX. Based on real data from the Yuntong 111 bus line in
   Beijing, China, the proposed short-turning strategy is deployed in a
   simulation experiment. The results show that the short-turning strategy
   is superior at alleviating bus bunching than the alternatives of no
   control strategy and the holding strategy. Compared with no control
   strategy, the short-turning strategy can achieve a more than 43.44\%
   reduction in schedule deviation and significantly reduce total passenger
   waiting time by up to 8.99\%.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching severely deteriorates the quality of transit service with
   poor on-time performance and excessive waiting time. To mitigate bus
   bunching, this paper presents a predictive framework to capture the
   stop-level headway irregularity based on transit smart card data.
   Historical headway, passenger demands, and travel time are utilized to
   model the headway fluctuation at the following stops. A Least Squares
   Support Vector Machine regression is established to detect bus bunching
   with the predicted headway pattern. An empirical experiment with two bus
   routes in Beijing is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach. The predictive method can successfully identify more
   than 95\% of bus bunching occurrences in comparison with other
   well-established prediction algorithms. Moreover, the detection accuracy
   does not significantly deteriorate as the prediction lead time
   increases. Instead of regularizing the headways at all costs by adopting
   certain correction actions, the proposed framework can provide timely
   and accurate information for potential bus bunching prevention and
   inform passengers when the next bus will arrive. This feature will
   greatly increase transit ridership and reduce operating costs for
   transit authorities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper elucidates the problem on bus bunching and the proposed
   solution to the problem. The motive is to consider the density of
   passengers and schedule the bus based on the density. The system is
   capable of considering the density by user-friendly mobile application.
   The mobile application is accessible within the personal area
   communication range of the bus terminus. The whole system is controlled
   by a low power, highly sustainable, and secured wireless technology. The
   main advantage of this proposal is to reduce unnecessary running of the
   buses, by which the fuel consumption is reduced and passengers need not
   wait for a longer time for the buses. The outcome of this result is to
   establish a well-maintained public transportation by reducing the
   problem of bus bunching.},

Title = {Application of modular vehicle technology to mitigate bus bunching},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {146},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The stochastic nature of public transport systems leads to headway
   variability and bus bunching, causing both operator and passenger cost
   to increase significantly. Traditional strategies to counter bus
   bunching, including bus-holding, stop-skipping, and bus
   substitution/insertion, suffer from trade-offs and shortcomings.
   Autonomous modular vehicle (AMV) technology provides an additional level
   of flexibility in bus dispatching and operations, which can offer
   significant benefits in mitigating bus bunching compared to strategies
   available with conventional buses. This paper introduces a novel
   alternative to stop-skipping by leveraging the new capabilities offered
   by AMVs (in particular, en-route coupling and decoupling of modular
   units). We develop a simple bus-splitting strategy that directs a
   modular bus to decouple into individual units when it experiences a
   headway longer than a given threshold. We then use a macroscopic
   simulation to present a proof-of-concept evaluation of the proposed
   modular strategy compared to a benchmark traditional stop-skipping
   strategy and the base (no control) case. We find that the proposed
   strategy outperforms the benchmark in decreasing each of the three
   travel time components: waiting time, in-vehicle time, and walking time
   (which it eliminates completely). It therefore reduces the overhead of
   bus bunching and thus the travel cost by more than twice as much as the
   benchmark for busy bus lines. Simultaneously, it also reduces headway
   variability to a comparable degree. Furthermore, we analyze different
   control thresholds for applying the proposed strategy, and show that it
   is most effective when applied proactively, i.e. with the control action
   being triggered even by small headway deviations.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to identify hot spots of bus bunching
   events at the network level, both in time and space, using Automatic
   Vehicle Location (AVL) data from the Athens (Greece) Public
   Transportation System. A two-step spatio-temporal clustering analysis is
   employed for identifying localized hot spots in space and time and for
   refining detected hot spots, based on the nature of bus bunching events.
   First, the Spatio-Temporal Density Based Scanning Algorithm with Noise
   (ST-DBSCAN) is applied to distinguish bunching patterns at the network
   level and subsequently a k++means algorithm is employed to distinguish
   different types of bunching clusters. Results offer insights on specific
   time periods and route segments, where bus bunching events are more
   likely to occur and, also, on how bus bunching clusters change over
   time. Further, headway deviation analysis reveals the differences in the
   characteristics of the various bunching event types per line, showing
   that routes running on shared corridors experience more issues while
   underlying causes may vary per line. Collectively, results can help
   guide practice toward more flexible solutions and control strategies.
   Indeed, depending on the type of spatio-temporal patterns detected,
   appropriate improvements in service planning and real-time control
   strategies may be identified in order to mitigate their negative effects
   and improve quality of service. In light of emerging electric public
   transport systems, the proposed framework can be also used to determine
   preventive strategies and improve reliability in affected stops prior to
   the deployment of charging infrastructure.},

Abstract = {If bus service departure times are not completely unknown to the
   passengers, non-uniform passenger arrival patterns can be expected. We
   propose that passengers decide their arrival time at stops based on a
   continuous logit model that considers the risk of missing services.
   Expected passenger waiting times are derived in a bus system that allows
   also for overtaking between bus services. We then propose an algorithm
   to derive the dwell time of subsequent buses serving a stop in order to
   illustrate when bus bunching might occur. We show that non-uniform
   arrival patterns can significantly influence the bus bunching process.
   With case studies we find that, even without exogenous delay, bunching
   can arise when the boarding rate is insufficient given the level of
   overall demand. Further, in case of exogenous delay, non-uniform
   arrivals can either worsen or improve the bunching conditions, depending
   on the level of delay. We conclude that therefore such effects should be
   considered when service control measures are discussed. (C) 2015 The

Title = {Travel Time Reliability Analysis Considering Bus Bunching: A Case Study
   in Xi'an, China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Bus bunching occurring at stops has an unstable impact on bus travel
   time. In order to evaluate urban bus travel time effectively, the travel
   time reliability (TTR) addressing bus bunching is analyzed. This paper
   focuses on the delayed time caused by bus bunching in the dwelling
   process at bus stops and uses the coefficient of variation of time
   headway to evaluate the degree of bus bunching. Moreover, the travel
   time deviation (TTD) indicator and travel time on-time accuracy (OTA)
   model are proposed to evaluate the bus TTR. The proposed model is used
   to analyze 113 runs of a bus route in Xi'an city, China. Real-time GPS
   data are used to analyze the operation of each run from the origin to
   the destination stops. The results show that 74.34\% of the runs are
   delayed. When the value of TTD is higher than |0.1|, 64.2\% of runs are
   delayed with bus bunching. Based on the measuring of OTA in two
   situations, the value of TTR considering bus bunching is reduced by
   20\%. In addition, the number of stopping routes at peak periods has a
   significant impact on the occurrence of bus bunching. The research
   results would have practical implications for the operation and
   management of buses.},

Abstract = {If bus service departure times are not completely unknown to the
   passengers, non-uniform passenger arrival patterns can be expected. We
   propose that passengers decide their arrival time at stops based on a
   continuous logit model that considers the risk of missing services.
   Expected passenger waiting times are derived in a bus system that allows
   also for overtaking between bus services. We then propose an algorithm
   to derive the dwell time of subsequent buses serving a stop in order to
   illustrate when bus bunching might occur. We show that non-uniform
   arrival patterns can significantly influence the bus bunching process.
   With case studies we find that, even without exogenous delay, bunching
   can arise when the boarding rate is insufficient given the level of
   overall demand. Further, in case of exogenous delay, non-uniform
   arrivals can either worsen or improve the bunching conditions, depending
   on the level of delay. We conclude that therefore such effects should be
   considered when service control measures are discussed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Bus bunching is a typical phenomenon observed in daily public transit
   operations and that significantly reduces the reliability and
   attractiveness of transit service. Although various control strategies,
   such as vehicle holding, speed guidance, and signal priority, have been
   proposed to eliminate or alleviate bus bunching, the impact of road
   traffic flow on bus bunching has not been well studied. To bridge this
   gap, this work proposes a new mesoscopic simulation model by
   incorporating the lattice Boltzmann model to simulate bus bunching
   considering the impacts of road traffic flow. Simulation results show
   that by utilizing the new simulation model, different phase diagrams can
   be observed. Under different conditions of traffic flow-density
   evolution, i.e., no oscillation, single oscillation, global oscillation,
   and irregular oscillation, the resulting bus trajectories are
   significantly different. In addition, an investigation of a real-world
   bus line in Beijing with global positioning system (GPS)-based vehicle
   location data shows that some results of the model are qualitatively
   consistent with the actual characteristics of the bus route. It shows
   that the proposed new simulation model has great potential for enhancing
   our understanding of the impacts of road traffic flow on bus bunching.},

Title = {Does bus bunching happen inevitably: The counteraction between link and
   stop headway deviations?},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Bus headway deviations are the major causes of bus bunching, which is
   detrimental to bus service reliability and leads to excessive waiting
   time for passengers. Generally, it is believed that bus bunching is an
   inevitable result once a service disturbance occurs, as long as the
   route is long enough. However, in this study, it goes as low as 5\% of
   all trips from the empirical data, con-tradicting the expectation in
   theory. This study explores the underlying reasons for this
   contra-diction based on empirical data from two representative bus
   routes in China. The results show that headway deviations on links and
   at stops mostly counteract with each other, constraining the occurrence
   of bus bunching. Under this counteraction effect, the path headway
   deviations remain within a stable range, normally bounded by the planned
   headway. It indicates that the bus system has a self-repair ability to
   resist headway disruptions, which explains why bus bunching happens at a
   considerably lower frequency in practice than in theory. We further
   discuss how the coun-teraction effect works. The insights gained from
   this study can shed light on preventing bus bunching and generating new
   ways to recover bus service regularity after a headway disruption. If we
   can adequately adjust the control methods to make the link and stop
   headway deviations counteract with each other, the bus system can
   automatically mitigate the headway deviations.},

Abstract = {Improving the sharing rate of public transportation is an important
   content for the sustainable development of urban transportation.
   However, bus bunching, a common phenomenon during transit operation,
   makes negative effects on reliability and service level of the bus
   system. In most urban centers in China, many bus lines usually serve in
   a corridor. Different buses may interact with each other in the
   corridor, which may aggravate the bus bunching. However, previous
   studies on bus bunching focused on single bus service. In addition, with
   the popularization of bus data acquisition and the maturity of data
   processing methods, the accuracy of bus bunching research meets more
   opportunities. In this paper, we proposed a holding strategy based on
   two-bus cooperative control. A simulation was carried out after
   preliminarily processing and analyzing the bus operation data of Foshan,
   Guangdong City. In the simulation, we compared the performance of three
   different scenarios, which are before control strategy, under the
   strategy for a single bus line and under the coordinated strategy for
   multiple bus lines. We contrastively analyze the results of the two
   strategies from different aspects. The results show that in aspects,
   such as holding a frequency, holding time, the total running time and
   the influence on the other bus line, the cooperative holding strategy
   manifests better. It illustrates that it is meaningful to do such a
   research on the effect of corridor service on bus bunching and add this
   effect into traditional holding strategy to build a multi-bus
   cooperative control strategy. The results have important theoretical
   significance for enriching and completing existing theory and methods of
   transit system and practical value for improving the service level and
   attractiveness of buses, increasing the share rate of public
   transportation, and thus, promoting the sustainable development of
   cities.},

Abstract = {Headway fluctuations and bus bunching are commonly observed phenomena in
   transit operations. In this article, we extend the fast traffic flow
   solver previously proposed for simulating moving bottlenecks to account
   for transit demand and traffic flows together. The buses are treated as
   moving bottlenecks in the traffic flow as their dynamics are affected by
   surrounding traffic, and vice versa. The dynamics of passengers are
   integrated to reproduce buses operations. Thanks to a semi-analytical
   approach, we are able to simulate some important aspects of real-life
   corridors, such as the buses obstructive effect on the surrounding
   traffic flow, and the environmental traffic effects to the bus bunching
   phenomenon and passenger waiting time. One can expect that this
   simulation framework can be employed for transit operation optimization
   problems where fast and accurate solutions are required.},

Abstract = {Bunching is recognized as one of the deteriorating factors affecting the
   performance of public transport networks. In this study, for the first
   time, Gene Expression Programming (GEP) and Decision Tree (DT) methods
   are utilized to estimate and model bus bunching. These methods are well
   equipped for dealing with nonlinearity and solving complex problems. The
   proposed models are compared against well-known Logistic Regression
   (LOR) models. Different spatial and temporal independent variables such
   as: bus dwell time, intersection delay, schedule deviation, bus stop
   spacing and bus stop closeness are used to model and study bus bunching
   in a real-life example in Auckland, New Zealand. Schedule deviation was
   determined to be the most influential factor for bus bunching
   occurrence. The DT method performed better in estimation of bus bunching

Abstract = {Headway fluctuations and ``bus bunching{''} are well known phenomena on
   many bus routes where an initial delay to one service can disturb the
   whole schedule due to resulting differences in dwell times of subsequent
   buses at stops. This paper deals with the influence of a frequent but so
   far largely neglected characteristic of bus networks on bus bunching,
   that is the presence of overtaking and common lines. A set of discrete
   state equations is implemented to obtain the departure times of a group
   of buses following the occurrence of an exogenous delay to one bus at a
   bus stop. Two models are distinguished depending on whether overtaking
   at stops is possible or not. If two buses board simultaneously and
   overtaking is not possible, passengers will board the front bus. If
   overtaking is possible, passengers form equilibrium queues in order to
   minimise their waiting times. Conditions for equilibrium queues among
   passengers with different choice sets are formulated. With a case study
   we then illustrate that, if overtaking is not allowed, the presence of
   common lines worsens the service regularity along the corridor.
   Conversely, common lines have positive effects when overtaking is
   possible. We suggest hence that appropriate network design is important
   to reduce the negative effects of delay-prone lines on the overall
   network performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An online learning approach to eliminate Bus Bunching in real-time},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},

Abstract = {Recent advances in telecommunications created new opportunities for
   monitoring public transport operations in real-time. This paper presents
   an automatic control framework to mitigate the Bus Bunching phenomenon
   in real-time. The framework depicts a powerful combination of distinct
   Machine Learning principles and methods to extract valuable information
   from raw location-based data. State-of-the-art tools and methodologies
   such as Regression Analysis, Probabilistic Reasoning and Perceptron's
   learning with Stochastic Gradient Descent constitute building blocks of
   this predictive methodology. The prediction's output is then used to
   select and deploy a corrective action to automatically prevent Bus
   Bunching. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using data
   collected from 18 bus routes in Porto, Portugal over a period of one
   year. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can
   potentially reduce bunching by 68\% and decrease average passenger
   waiting times by 4.5\%, without prolonging in-vehicle times. The
   proposed system could be embedded in a decision support system to
   improve control room operations. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Traditional bus bunching control methods (e.g., adding slack to
   schedules, adapting cruising speed), in one way or another, trade
   commercial speed for better system stability and, as a result, may
   impose the burden of additional travel time on passengers. Recently, a
   dynamic bus substitution strategy, where standby buses are dispatched to
   take over service from late/early buses, was proposed as an attempt to
   enhance system reliability without sacrificing too much passenger
   experience. This paper further studies this substitution strategy in the
   context of multiple bus lines under either time-independent or time
   varying settings. In the latter scenario, the fleet of standby buses can
   be dynamically utilized to save on opportunity costs. We model the
   agency's substitution decisions and retired bus repositioning decisions
   as a stochastic dynamic program so as to obtain the optimal policy that
   minimizes the system-wide costs. Numerical results show that the dynamic
   substitution strategy can benefit from the ``economies of scale{''} by
   pooling the standby fleet across lines, and there are also benefits from
   dynamic fleet management when transit demand varies over time. Numerical
   examples are presented to illustrate the applicability and advantage of
   the proposed strategy. The substitution strategy not only holds the
   promise to outperform traditional holding methods in terms of reducing
   passenger costs, they also can be used to complement other methods to
   better control very unstable systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Analysis of Bus Bunching Impact on Car Delays at Signalized

Abstract = {In uncontrolled bus systems, buses tend to bunch due to the stochastic
   nature of traffic flows and passenger demands at bus stops. It is widely
   acknowledged that bus bunching affects transit operations increasing
   passenger waiting times and variability. However, transit systems are a
   part of urban transportation systems. Accordingly, buses also affect
   traffic flows at signalized intersections leading to additional car
   delays. In this paper, the impact of a linear bus stop on cars caused by
   one bus is analyzed by employing the shockwave theory. Further, the
   operating characteristics of bus bunching in terms of the dwell time at
   a linear stop are analyzed, in both passenger self-organization and
   stop-skipping control strategy scenarios. Then, the total dwell time of
   two bunched buses is calculated, considering different passengers on the
   two successive buses and the difference between boarding and alighting
   passengers. Finally, the proposed car delays model is simulated with the
   aid of computer, where numerical analysis is done to obtain the
   difference in car delays between two evenly spaced buses and two bunched
   buses. The results of the numerical analysis indicate that bunched buses
   lead to additional car delays compared to evenly spaced buses. In
   addition, numerical tests are conducted for the self-organization and
   stop-skipping control strategies considering imbalanced passengers on
   two successive buses and the difference between boarding and alighting
   passengers. The results show that larger differences between the numbers
   of passengers on the two bunched buses and lower differences between the
   numbers of boarding and alighting passengers lead to larger car delays.},

Title = {Holding times to maintain quasi-regular headways and reduce real-time
   bus bunching},
Journal = {PUBLIC TRANSPORT},

Month = {2023 MAY 17},
Abstract = {Real-time control strategies deal with the day's dynamics in bus rapid
   transit systems. This work focuses on minimizing the number of buses of
   the same line cruising head-to-tail or arriving at a stop simultaneously
   by implementing bus holding times at the stops as a control strategy. We
   propose a new mathematical model to determine the bus holding times. It
   has quadratic constraints but a linear objective function that minimizes
   the bus bunching penalties. We also propose a beam-search heuristic to
   reduce computational solution time to solve large instances.
   Experimental results on a bus rapid transit system simulation in
   Monterrey, Mexico, show a bus bunching reduction of 45\% compared to the
   case without optimization. Moreover, passenger waiting times are reduced
   by 30\% in some scenarios. For real-world instances with 60 buses, the
   beam-search approach provides solutions with an optimality gap of less
   than 5\% in less than 3 s.},

Abstract = {Due to the inherent uncertainties of the bus system, bus bunching
   remains a challenging problem that degrades bus service reliability and
   causes passenger dissatisfaction. This paper introduces a novel deep
   reinforcement learning framework specifically designed to address the
   bus bunching problem by implementing dynamic holding control in a
   multi-agent system. We formulate the bus holding problem as a
   decentralized, partially observable Markov decision process and develop
   an event-driven simulator to emulate real-world bus operations. An
   approach based on deep Q-learning with parameter sharing is proposed to
   train the agents. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the
   proposed framework against multiple baseline strategies. The proposed
   approach has proven to be adaptable to the uncertainties in bus
   operations. The results highlight the significant advantages of the deep
   reinforcement learning framework across various performance metrics,
   including reduced passenger waiting time, more balanced bus load
   distribution, decreased occupancy variability, and shorter travel time.
   The findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for
   practical application in real-world bus systems, offering promising
   solutions to mitigate bus bunching and enhance overall service quality.},

   Control and Passenger Swapping Behavior},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION},

Abstract = {The conventional bus propagation modeling process has two main
   shortcomings: bus bunching and extra energy consumption caused by idling
   at signalized intersections and unexpected speed variation along the
   route. To overcome these problems simultaneously, an extended bus
   propagation model and anti-bunching control are proposed in this paper.
   To extend the time-based bus propagation model, the authors used a
   finite state machine and an intelligent driver model to establish a
   spatial-temporal based bus propagation model accounting for dynamic bus
   motion and passenger swapping behavior between bunched buses. To
   mitigate bus bunching and improve fuel economy in a connected
   environment, an anticipated average speed plan was used to improve
   headway regularity and reduce the chance of encountering a red signal.
   Then, predictive control accounting for state and control constraints
   was used to generate a smooth trajectory for connected buses to follow
   the commands given by anticipated average speed planning. This ensured
   that connected buses traversed signalized intersections and approached
   downstream stops efficiently. Simulations show that the proposed model
   can imitate passenger swapping behavior when bus bunching occurs, and
   the anti-bunching control can mitigate bus bunching and guide connected
   buses to traverse signalized intersections and reach downstream stops
   with less delay.},

Title = {A Real-Time Control Strategy for Bus Operation to Alleviate Bus Bunching},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In order to alleviate bus bunching and improve the balance and
   punctuality rate of bus operation, a single-line real-time control
   strategy based on Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) was proposed.
   The strategy took three measures: controlling the cruising speed, dwell
   time, and the bus load rate to improve the stability of bus operations
   and to ensure its running speed. At the same time, the proposed strategy
   was compared with the literature on the traditional single-point control
   strategy based on timetable (S1 for short) and the multi-point control
   strategy based on time headway (S2 for short). Finally, the No. 245 bus
   line in Nanchang City, China, was selected as a case. It was modeled and
   simulated by Python programming software, and the control effects of the
   three control strategies were analyzed. Compared with the uncontrolled
   bus operations, the simulation results show that: under the control of
   S1, the bus operation stability is improved, but the bus operation
   efficiency is reduced; under the control of S2, the problem of S1
   operation efficiency reduction can be solved, and the operation
   stability can be improved at the same time to achieve the effect of
   preventing bunching. For the real-time control strategy (S3 for short),
   the average bus travel time is the smallest, the distance between the
   buses is maintained the best, and the running stability is also the
   best, which avoids the bus bunching to the greatest extent. Among them,
   the average travel time is reduced by about 34\% compared with the
   second strategy. This study provides a theoretical basis and strategy
   reference for bus operators to ensure balanced bus operation.},

Abstract = {A common problem in public transport systems is bus bunching,
   characterized by a negative feedback loop between service headways,
   number of boarding passengers and dwell times. In this study, we examine
   whether providing real-time crowding information (RTCI) at the stop
   regarding the two next vehicle departures can stimulate passengers to
   wait for a less-crowded departure, and thus alleviate the bunching
   effect. To this end, we leverage on results from own stated-preference
   survey and develop a boarding choice model. The model accounts for the
   presence of RTCI and is implemented within dynamic public transport
   simulation framework. Application to the case-study model of a major bus
   corridor in Warsaw (Poland) reveals that RTCI can induce a significant
   probability (30-70\%) of intentionally skipping an overcrowded bus and
   waiting for a later departure instead. This behaviour, in turn, results
   in significantly lower vehicle headway and load variations, without
   deteriorations in total waiting utility. Overall, journey experience
   improves by 6\%, and crucially-the prevalence of denial-of-boarding and
   excessive on-board overcrowding is substantially reduced, by ca. 40\%.
   Results of our study indicate that the willingness to wait induced by
   RTCI can be a potential demand management strategy in counteracting
   bunching, with benefits already attainable at limited RTCI response
   rates.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching is a common phenomenon caused by irregular bus headway,
   which increases the passenger waiting time, makes the passenger capacity
   uneven, and severely reduces the reliability of bus service. This paper
   clarified the process of bus bunching formation, analyzed the variation
   characteristics of bus bunching in a single day, in different types of
   periods, and at different bus stops, then concluded twelve potential
   factors. A hybrid model integrating a genetic algorithm with elitist
   preservation strategy (eGA) and decision tree (DT) was proposed. The eGA
   part constructs the model framework and transforms the factor
   identification into a problem of selecting the fittest individual from
   the population, while the DT part evaluates the fitness. Model
   verification and comparison were conducted based on real automatic
   vehicle location (AVL) data in Shenzhen, China. The results showed that
   the proposed eGA-DT model outperformed other frequently used single DT
   and extra tree (ET) models with at least a 20\% reduction in MAE under
   different bus routes, periods, and bus stops. Six factors, including the
   sequence of the bus stop, the headway and dwell time at the previous bus
   stop, the travel time between bus stops, etc., were identified to have a
   significant effect on bus bunching, which is of great value for feature
   selection to improve the accuracy and efficiency of bus bunching
   prediction and real-time bus dispatching.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching is a well-known phenomenon on many bus routes where an
   initial delay to one service can disturb the whole schedule due to
   resulting differences in dwell times of subsequent buses at stops. This
   paper deals with the passenger behaviour when there is more than one bus
   serving the stop, focusing on their choices and possible switching
   actions from the queue of the bus they are waiting to board. A parameter
   is introduced to denote the percentage of passengers boarding the front
   bus of two buses boarding at the same time. Cases when overtaking is
   allowed or not are distinguished as this will also influence the
   passenger behaviour. A set of discrete state equations is then
   implemented to obtain the departure times of the buses following the
   occurrence of an exogenous delay to one of the buses. Evaluation indices
   are introduced to measure the performance of the bus service along a
   corridor under different levels. We show that it is advantageous to keep
   the percentage of passengers boarding the front bus low. Beside,
   overtaking is a favourable counter-measure against comparatively high
   front-bus preference.},

Title = {Modelling bus bunching along a common line corridor considering
   passenger arrival time and transfer choice under stochastic travel time},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW},

Abstract = {This study examines bus bunching along a common-line corridor,
   considering crucial factors underexplored in existing literature, such
   as stochastic travel times, passenger arrival patterns, and passenger
   transfer behaviours. We first develop a bus motion model that captures
   the interaction between bus trajectories and passenger movement. Then we
   formulate a reliability -based passenger arrival time choice and a
   transfer choice model to characterise passengers' behaviours.
   Afterwards, the bus motion model and the passenger choice models are
   integrated, and a Method of Successive Averages type iterative algorithm
   is developed to obtain stable passenger arrival patterns and transfer
   choices. Numerical experiments are carried out on a hypothetical network
   followed by a case with real-world data. Our findings demonstrate that a
   high transfer demand could amplify the propagation of bus bunching
   across lines along the common-line corridor. Meanwhile, a 50\% increase
   in transfer demand leads to a 24\%- 30\% rise in headway fluctuation.
   Furthermore, our results suggest that non-uniform passenger accumulation
   patterns can restore headway regularity as a result of coordinated
   passenger movement and bus motions, thus alleviating the persistent
   deterioration in bus bunching.},

Title = {Modelling bus bunching and holding control with vehicle overtaking and
   distributed passenger boarding behaviour},

Abstract = {Headway fluctuation and bus bunching are commonly observed in transit
   operations, while holding control is a proven strategy to reduce bus
   bunching and improve service reliability. A transit operator would
   benefit from an accurate forecast of bus propagation in order to
   effectively control the system. To this end, we propose an `ad-hoc' bus
   propagation model taking into account vehicle overtaking and distributed
   passenger boarding (DPB) behaviour. The latter represents the dynamic
   passenger queue swapping among buses when bunching at bus stops occurs
   and where bus capacity constraints are explicitly considered. The
   enhanced bus propagation model is used to build the simulation
   environment where different holding control strategies are tested. A
   quasi first-depart-first-hold (FDFH) rule is applied to the design of
   schedule- and headway-based holding control allowing for overtaking,
   with the objective to minimise the deviation from the targeted headway.
   The effects of control strategies are tested in an idealised bus route
   under different operational setting and in a real bus route in
   Guangzhou. We show that when the combined overtaking and queue-swapping
   behaviour are considered, the control strategies can achieve better
   headway regularity, less waiting time and less on-board travel time than
   their respective versions without overtaking and DPB. The benefit is
   even greater when travel time variability is higher and headway is
   smaller, suggesting that the control strategies are preferably deployed
   in high-frequency service. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Providing public transportation with quality service is critical to
   attracting more passengers to the system. However, high-demand routes
   are prone to the so-called bus bunching-a tendency of buses to group as
   a consequence of variations in travel times and demands. Bus holding is
   applied to overcome this effect. In this study, we present a novel
   method for bus holding in which the control law is based only on the
   buses' position using a computationally efficient rolling horizon
   approach. The method uses similar inputs as linear control approaches
   while not increasing significantly the computational time. On the other
   hand, the method overcomes a key weakness of the linear control approach
   thanks to the explicit constraint handling that always ensures the
   control action effectiveness. Simulation experiments in a validation
   case and a model-specific for a bus rapid transit line in Curitiba,
   Brazil, showed a reduced holding time and improved resilience,
   delivering more than 20\% reduction in delay time accounting for the
   on-board and station delays.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we presented a probabilistic framework to predict Bus
   Bunching (BB) occurrences in real-time. It uses both historical and
   real-time data to approximate the headway distributions on the further
   stops of a given route by employing both offline and online supervised
   learning techniques. Such approximations are incrementally calculated by
   reusing the latest prediction residuals to update the further ones.
   These update rules extend the Perceptron's delta rule by assuming an
   adaptive beta value based on the current context. These distributions
   are then used to compute the likelihood of forming a bus platoon on a
   further stop - which may trigger an threshold-based BB alarm. This
   framework was evaluated using real-world data about the trips of 3 bus
   lines throughout an year running on the city of Porto, Portugal. The
   results are promising.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching is a long-standing problem in transit operation and ruining
   the regularity of transit service. In a typical urban transit network
   setting of multiple lines with a shared corridor, bus bunching becomes
   more frequent as there is more uncertainty inside the shared corridor.
   While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been a promising
   scheme for learning efficient control policy in a multi-agent system,
   few studies have explored its applicability in multi-line transit
   control scenarios. In this study, we focus on a basic transit network
   where there are two bus lines with a shared corridor. An efficient MARL
   framework is proposed to learn multi-line bus holding control to avoid
   bus bunching. Specifically, we design observation and reward functions
   that incorporate multi-line information. In addition, a preference
   weights producer is introduced to update the objective weights towards a
   good trajectory evaluation during daily transit operation. In this way,
   we handle the multi-objective issue in multi-line control. In
   experimental studies, we validate the superiority of the method in
   real-world bus lines. Results show that the state and reward augmented
   with multi-line information benefit MARL in multi-line bus control.
   Besides, by updating preference weights towards less passenger waiting
   time, the regularity of transit service is further improved.},

Title = {Bus splitting and bus holding: A new strategy using autonomous modular
   buses for preventing bus bunching},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {177},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Autonomous Modular Buses (AMBs) with in-motion transfer capability can
   be more effective in preventing bus bunching than strategies available
   with conventional buses, such as bus-holding and/or stop-skipping. We
   previously proposed bus-splitting, a novel alternative to stop-skipping
   that directs a modular bus to decouple into individual units when it
   experiences a longer than normal headway. Despite outperforming
   stop-skipping, bus-splitting alone cannot eliminate bunching completely
   since it cannot increase short headways. Therefore, we now propose an
   integrated strategy that combines bus-splitting with bus-holding so that
   headways that are both shorter or longer than required can be corrected.
   We conduct a macroscopic simulation based on a bus route in Hangzhou,
   China, to compare our combined strategy with standalone bus-splitting as
   well as stop-skipping combined with bus-holding. Our strategy
   outperforms the others in terms of reducing both the average travel cost
   and its variation, limiting the overhead of bus bunching to below 10\%
   under realistic system utilization levels. A bus service adopting the
   proposed strategy would therefore be more cost-effective, reliable, and
   attractive for commuters, potentially increasing its ridership and
   reducing the mode share of private vehicles.},

Title = {Impact Analysis of Traffic Factors on Urban Bus Bunching},
Journal = {IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 2},
Abstract = {Due to the mixed right-of-way and varying traffic conditions, urban bus
   operations are often subject to random delays and eventually bus
   bunching, undermining the schedule reliability. The existing studies
   have proposed different models to emulate bus bunching and control
   strategies to mitigate bus bunching, yet few of them considered the
   effect of the three important traffic factors: intersections with signal
   coordination, varying traffic volume, and passenger demand. To fill in
   the research gap, we first define the stop-level frequency of bus
   bunching events for a bus route in this study. We proceed to present a
   simulation-based approach to quantify the impact of the three traffic
   factors on bus bunching. Numerical experiments based on different
   scenarios are carried out to reveal the cause-effect relationship
   between these factors and bus bunching events. Contributors to bus
   bunching are evaluated, and the effect of control delays is examined
   through statistical measurements. Finally, a real-world case study based
   on bus route 51 in Singapore is performed, and some insights are
   provided to alleviate the bus bunching phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching resulting from initially small headway irregularities is a
   widely-known and studied problem. A variety of headway-prediction
   approaches, as well as corrective strategies, have been developed to
   identify and correct headway irregularity in real time. Instead of
   predicting an exact value for future headways, this study explores a
   probabilistic predictive methodology to forecast whether or not a bus
   will be bunched during its dwelling at a downstream stop, using a
   logistic regression model based on GPS records of buses at least k stops
   upstream to allow for sufficient time to possibly implement control
   strategies. A case study is conducted on a circular bus route in Kyoto
   City. Compared to two headway-based prediction approaches using linear
   regression and support vector machine, the superior performance of the
   proposed tool in detecting bunching is illustrated by Receiver Operator
   Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The high reliability in long-term
   prediction gives adequate time for operators to employ countermeasures.
   Besides, the proposed method provides operators with tradeoff options.
   We find that a bunching-averse operator can obtain 95\%
   ``sensitivity{''}, that is the ratio of correctly identified bunching
   events, at the cost of decreasing ``specificity{''}, which is the ratio
   of correct non-bunching predictions over all events. This is true even
   if the prediction horizon is more than 10 stops.},

Abstract = {Dealing with bus bunching is a challenge for bus operators, as it
   strongly affects perception on the level of service provided by buses.
   Despite the growing interest on bus bunching, existing studies have
   focused on its frequency, neglecting potential differences in the
   intensity of bus bunching events and, thus, in the associated effect on
   passengers. This study focuses on the duration of bus bunching events,
   as a measure of both the problem magnitude and its impact on passengers.
   Hazard-based duration models are employed to bus bunching event data
   from the Athens Public Transport Network to estimate the effect of and
   understand the factors that affect bus bunching event durations. The
   Lognormal Accelerated Failure Time model performs best among parametric
   models, with deep survival analysis achieving superior predictive
   accuracy. Results show that temporal factors, such as the afternoon
   peaks and weekends affect bunching duration. Further, physical and
   operational characteristics of the initial point in a sequence of bus
   stop instances also have an impact on the duration of bunching. Overall,
   results can shed light at the contributing factors of bus bunching
   events duration and help operators prioritize interventions at the level
   of bus stops.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates bus bunching issues encountered with a single
   bus line. A real-time speed control model was proposed with the
   objective of minimizing variations in bus headway. Three cases of a
   typical road infrastructure for bus lines were studied. Two main factors
   that influence the stability of bus service-namely, signalized
   intersection delays and heterogeneous roadway conditions-were studied in
   the modeling process. In addition, other common variables were
   considered, including the time required for passengers to board a bus
   and alight from it. Compared with findings from prior literature, that
   frequently assumed homogeneous roadway infrastructure conditions and
   ignored intersection delays. The built model output the degree of speed
   adjustment required in accordance with different roadway configurations
   and the congestion level at each road section. A case study was designed
   to test the performance of the proposed model, based on the data
   collected from 40 bus stops, on Bus route No. 600 in Xi'an, China.
   Results showed that the proposed model could effectively restrain the
   problems posed by headway deviations and reduce travel time for the
   passengers.},

Title = {Dynamic holding control to avoid bus bunching: A multi-agent deep
   reinforcement learning framework},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bus bunching has been a long-standing problem that undermines the
   efficiency and reliability of public transport services. The most
   popular countermeasure in practice is to introduce static and dynamic
   holding control. However, most previous holding control strategies
   mainly consider local information with a pre-specified headway/schedule,
   while the global coordination of the whole bus fleet and its long-term
   effect are often overlooked. To efficiently incorporate global
   coordination and long-term operation in bus holding, in this paper we
   propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) framework to
   develop dynamic and flexible holding control strategies for a bus route.
   Specifically, we model each bus as an agent that interacts with not only
   its leader/follower but also all other vehicles in the fleet. To better
   explore potential strategies, we develop an effective headway-based
   reward function in the proposed framework. In the learning framework, we
   model fleet coordination by using a basic actor-critic scheme along with
   a joint action tracker to better characterize the complex interactions
   among agents in policy learning, and we apply proximal policy
   optimization to improve learning performance. We conduct extensive
   numerical experiments to evaluate the proposed MDRL framework against
   multiple baseline models that only rely on local information. Our
   results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework and show
   the promise of applying MDRL in the coordinative control of public
   transport vehicle fleets in real-world operations.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching can deteriorate bus service quality and jeopardise the
   effectiveness of public transit in promoting sustainable urban
   transport. This study applies artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in
   visual analytics to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of bus
   bunching from a stop-based perspective. A total of 25 405 real-time
   traffic images were extracted and analysed from 11 bus stops in Hong
   Kong in August 2019 (7am-7pm, Tuesdays-Thursdays). An image
   classification model was developed with an overall accuracy of 85\%.
   Three distinct groups were identified based on the spatiotemporal
   characteristics of bus bunching at different bus stops. They are (a)
   systematic peak hour, (b) minor and intermittent and (c) random bus
   bunching. Specific traffic conditions in terms of traffic speed, traffic
   composition and bus occupancy rate are highly associated with the onset
   of bus bunching. Overall traditional bus management tactics, such as
   schedule synchronisation and headways control, need to be supplemented
   by stop-based strategies that consider the temporal profiles of bus
   bunching and associated traffic conditions on road.},

Abstract = {Regarding tools and systems from artificial intelligence (AI),
   chat-based ones from the area of generative AI have become a major focus
   regarding media coverage. ChatGPT and occasionally other systems (such
   as those from Microsoft and Google) are discussed with hundreds if not
   thousands of academic papers as well as newspaper articles. While
   various areas have considerably gone into this discussion,
   transportation and logistics has not yet come that far. In this paper,
   we explore the use of generative AI tools within this domain. More
   specifically, we focus on a topic related to sustainable passenger
   transportation, that is, the handling of disturbances in public
   transport when it comes to bus bunching and bus bridging. The first of
   these concepts is related to analyzing situations where we observe two
   or more buses of the same line following close to each other without
   being planned deliberately and the second is related to the case where
   buses are used to replace broken connections in other systems, such as
   subways. Generative AI tools seem to be able to provide meaningful
   entries and a lot of food for thought while the academic use may still
   be classified as limited.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching is a well-known problem in public transport networks. It is
   characterized by a self-amplifying relationship between uneven
   distribution of rising passenger loads and deteriorating service
   regularity. The focus of this study is to analyse whether this negative
   feedback loop can be addressed by providing real-time crowding
   information (RTCI) on next vehicle departures at stops. We integrate a
   departure choice model based on stated-preference analysis of
   passengers' willingness to wait with RTCI. A proof-of-concept
   application to a toy-network model shows that this prevents further
   progression of bunching effects in certain demand conditions. The RTCI
   usage reveals substantial benefits - in terms of relative reductions in
   on-board (over)crowding, headway deviations, as well as mitigated
   denial-of-boarding risk - in moderately saturated network. These gains
   may diminish though as high overcrowding eventually emerges in PT
   network. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that RTCI has the potential
   to improve travel experience and service utilisation efficiency, even
   without resorting to supply-side control strategies.},

Title = {A connected-vehicle-based dynamic control model for managing the bus
   bunching problem with capacity constraints},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {This paper describes a connected-vehicle-based system architecture which
   can provide more precise and comprehensive information on bus movements
   and passenger status. Then a dynamic control method is proposed using
   connected vehicle data. Traditionally, the bus bunching problem has been
   formulated into one of two types of optimization problem. The first uses
   total passenger time cost as the objective function and capacity, safe
   headway, and other factors as constraints. Due to the large number of
   scenarios considered, this type of framework is inefficient for
   real-time implementation. The other type uses headway adherence as the
   objective and applies a feedback control framework to minimize headway
   variations. Due to the simplicity in the formulation and solution
   algorithms, the headway-based models are more suitable for real-time
   transit operations. However, the headway-based feedback control
   framework proposed in the literature still assumes homogeneous
   conditions at all bus stations, and does not consider restricting
   passenger loads within the capacity constraints. In this paper, a
   dynamic control framework is proposed to improve not only headway
   adherence but also maintain the stability of passenger load within bus
   capacity in both homogenous and heterogeneous situations at bus
   stations. The study provides the stability conditions for optimal
   control with heterogeneous bus conditions and derives optimal control
   strategies to minimize passenger transit cost while maintaining vehicle
   loading within capacity constraints. The proposed model is validated
   with a numerical analysis and case study based on field data collected
   in Chengdu, China. The results show that the proposed model performs
   well on high-demand bus routes.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching seriously damages the quality of transit service. This
   paper proposes a predictive approach to detect the occurrence of bus
   bunching depending on transit smart card data analysis. Several
   different support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are established to
   detect bus bunching based on the stop-level headway irregularity. An
   empirical experiment in Changzhou is conducted to analyze and compare
   the performances of different algorithms in practical applications. By
   comparing the prediction accuracy and computation efficiency, the
   optimal model is determined under different scenarios. The results
   suggest transit operators should use least squares support vector
   machine with linear kernel when the size of training dataset is large.
   Traditional SVM with linear kernel might be a better option for ensuring
   the prediction accuracy on smaller datasets. This strategy may improve
   transit service and increase transit ridership.},

Title = {A novel control strategy in mitigating bus bunching: Utilizing real-time
   information},
Journal = {TRANSPORT POLICY},

Abstract = {A variety of control mechanisms have been recommended to concentrate on
   the issue of bus bunching. However, the majority of existing measures
   focus on controlling the bus operation directly from the operator's
   perspective. This study, nevertheless, presents a novel control
   technique by providing passengers with real-time wait time information
   and degrees of in-vehicle congestion. Specifically, passengers are
   expected to use the given information to calculate the overall travel
   cost and, therefore, make decisions on whether boarding on the arriving
   bus or waiting for the next buses. In this way, bus service operators
   would reduce bus bunching by adjusting passengers' boarding choice
   behavior rather than controlling the bus vehicles directly. We propose a
   bus traffic propagation model to simulate the bus movements, through
   which several system performance metrics, such as the shortest vehicle
   spacing distribution and the average ridership per bus vehicle at each
   stop, can be evaluated for different bus bunching control measures. The
   numerical results show that providing in-vehicle congestion information
   is as effective as the schedule-based and headway-based control methods
   in achieving mitigation of bus bunching. Passengers on long trips are
   more inclined to wait for a few more shifts for a bus that is not very
   crowded. This study proposes a novel control strategy by offering
   passengers real-time information to serve as a supplement, never a
   substitute, to the existing control measures in mitigating bus bunching
   problems.},

Title = {Bus bunching as a synchronisation phenomenon},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Bus bunching is a perennial phenomenon that not only diminishes the
   efficiency of a bus system, but also prevents transit authorities from
   keeping buses on schedule. We present a physical theory of buses serving
   a loop of bus stops as a ring of coupled self-oscillators, analogous to
   the Kuramoto model. Sustained bunching is a repercussion of the process
   of phase synchronisation whereby the phases of the oscillators are
   locked to each other. This emerges when demand exceeds a critical
   threshold. Buses also bunch at low demand, albeit temporarily, due to
   frequency detuning arising from different human drivers' distinct
   natural speeds. We calculate the critical transition when complete phase
   locking (full synchronisation) occurs for the bus system, and posit the
   critical transition to completely no phase locking (zero
   synchronisation). The intermediate regime is the phase where clusters of
   partially phase locked buses exist. Intriguingly, these theoretical
   results are in close correspondence to real buses in a university's
   shuttle bus system.},

Title = {A Self-Adjusting Method to Resist Bus Bunching Based on Boarding Limits},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {Bus bunching is one of the most serious problems of urban bus systems.
   Bus bunching increases waiting and travel time of passengers. Many bus
   systems use schedules to reach equal headways. Compared to the idea of
   schedules and the target headway introduced later, we propose a new
   method to improve the efficiency of a bus system and avoid bus bunching
   by boarding limits. Our solution can be effectively implemented when
   buses cannot travel as planned because of bad road conditions and
   dynamic demands at bus stops. Besides, using our method, bus headways
   reach the state with equal headways dynamically and spontaneously
   without drivers' explicit intervention. Moreover, the method can improve
   the level of the bus service and reduce total travel time of passengers.
   We verify our method using an ideal bus route and a real bus route, both
   showing the success of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Bus schedules cannot be easily maintained on busy lines with short
   headways: experience shows that buses offering this type of service
   usually arrive irregularly at their stops, often in bunches. Although
   transit agencies build slack into their schedules to alleviate this
   problem - if necessary holding buses at control points to stay on
   schedule - their attempts often fail because practical amounts of slack
   cannot prevent large localized disruptions from spreading system-wide.
   This paper systematically analyzes an adaptive control scheme to
   mitigate this problem. The proposed scheme dynamically determines bus
   holding times at a route's control points based on real-time headway
   information. The method requires less slack than the conventional,
   schedule-based approach to produce headways within a given tolerance.
   This allows buses to travel faster than with the conventional approach,
   reducing in-vehicle passenger delay and increasing bus productivity. (C)

Abstract = {The primary challenge for an urban bus system is to maintain constant
   headways between successive buses. Most bus systems try to achieve this
   by adherence to a schedule; but this is undermined by the tendency of
   headways to collapse, so that buses travel in bunches. To counter this,
   we propose a new method of coordinating buses. Our method abandons the
   idea of a schedule and even any a priori target headway. Under our
   scheme headways are dynamically self-equalizing and the natural headway
   of the system tends to emerge spontaneously. Headways also become
   self-correcting in that after disturbances they reequalize without
   intervention by management or even awareness of the drivers.
   We report on a successful implementation to control a bus route in

Abstract = {Holding-based control methods for bus operation are examined to point
   out that allowing greater variance in headways between consecutive buses
   leads to possible gains in total delay, as compared to strict adherence
   to a service headway. This result, obtained empirically, indicates that
   optimal operation is not necessarily attained with even headways. Such
   finding is related to the well-known fact that there should not be too
   many control points for headway corrections when operating under the
   traditional method of scheduled departures from bus stations. Current
   feedback and predictive methods, however, can be productively applied at
   all stations, hence the importance of studying the effects of frequent
   control actions. Several feedback schemes are tested, as well as a
   rolling horizon predictive control method that seeks to minimize onboard
   and at, station delays. The latter has 110 headway reference and hence
   yields larger headway variations. The scenario is a BET corridor modeled
   in a microsimulation environment,. Simulation results indicate gains of
   29\% in total delay for predictive control in relation to open loop
   operation, and superior performance when compared to the tested
   proportional feedback control methods. (C) 2016, IFAC (International

Abstract = {Bunching is an operational problem, in bus transit systems with high
   service frequency, that can lower capacity and affects user
   satisfaction. The headway (i.e. amount of time between transit vehicle
   arrivals at a stop) is intrinsically unstable, such that minor
   disturbances can cause divergence from the scheduled service. In this
   paper, a bus route is modelled using a one-dimensional cellular
   automatato investigate the effects of variations in passenger demand on
   headway instability and thebus bunching phenomenon. Unlike previous
   research, this study utilizes a typical route design approach, rather
   than obtaining a phase diagram from random passengerdemand and service
   frequency. The results show that aone-second decrease in boarding and
   alighting times per passenger can significantly reduce bunching
   formation. Such a reduction can be achieved by adopting in-station fare
   collection methods as opposed to onboard ones, and/or using low-floor
   buses with wider/multiple doors/channels. In addition, an active
   mitigation strategy is proposed to prevent theformationof bunching. It
   is shown that limiting the waiting time for the delayed bus at stops has
   a great effect on regulating headways and mitigating bunching. Further,
   to compare different bunching situations, a new index is proposed to
   evaluate bunching severity (i.e. the number of buses involved in
   bunching)and intensity(i.e. the overall deviation from the scheduled
   headway). Using the developed index, it is found that a high Peak-Hour
   Coefficientacts like an uncontrolled traffic light that regulates the
   bus flow, resulting in less severe bunching, regardless of the
   subsequent total delay in the service.},

Abstract = {If transit agencies wish to retain and attract riders, they need to
   provide reliable and efficient services. Transit agencies tend to run
   high-frequency bus routes during peak hours, and in many cities,
   different routes can also overlap along major corridors. In some
   instances, consecutive buses can arrive at a shared stop simultaneously
   or one bus may arrive while another bus is currently servicing the stop.
   This phenomenon, known as bus bunching, can delay buses and passengers,
   and is usually inefficient. In this study, we attempt to understand how
   bus bunching from the same or different routes can impact bus
   operations, specifically dwell and running times. This research uses
   stop-level records obtained from automatic vehicle location (AVL) and
   automatic passenger counter (APC) systems from TriMet, Portland, OR.
   Using linear modeling, we find that bus bunching increases both dwell
   and running times. Specifically, when different routes bunch or are
   scheduled to arrive at a bus stop within a short time frame, or when
   buses from the same route arrive with a short time frame, dwell times
   increase by similar to 10 s. Similarly, bus bunching from the same route
   or different route prolongs running times by similar to 40 s. Our
   findings suggest that bus schedulers and operators should consider
   adding more time between consecutive buses from different routes at
   shared stops to minimize the negative impacts that we observed from bus
   bunching.},

Journal = {COMPLEXITY},

Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {Bus bunching is ostensibly regarded as a detrimental phenomenon in bus
   systems. We study a bus loop with two bus stops, one regular bus stop
   and one spike bus stop, where bunched buses can outperform staggered
   buses. The spike bus stop models a bus stop connected to a train or
   metro service, where passengers arrive in groups at periodic intervals
   (spikes). We introduce the configuration of synchronised bunched buses,
   where bunched buses wait for the spike in demand. For a wide range of
   parameters, synchronised bunched buses outperform perfectly staggered
   buses in terms of minimising the waiting time of commuters. We present
   an analytical formulation of the average waiting time in the case of
   bunched buses, synchronised bunched buses, and perfectly staggered buses
   with the consideration of different passenger demands, number of buses,
   and bus capacity. We demonstrate the validity of our analytical results
   through an agent-based simulation of the bus loop system.},

Title = {Analysis and Simulation of Intervention Strategies against Bus Bunching
   by means of an Empirical Agent-Based Model},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an empirically based Monte Carlo bus-network
   (EMB) model as a test bed to simulate intervention strategies to
   overcome the inefficiencies of bus bunching. The EMB model is an
   agent-based model which utilizes the positional and temporal data of the
   buses obtained from the Global Positioning System (GPS) to constitute
   (1) a set of empirical velocity distributions of the buses and (2) a set
   of exponential distributions of interarrival time of passengers at the
   bus stops. Monte Carlo sampling is then performed on these two derived
   probability distributions to yield the stochastic dynamics of both the
   buses' motion and passengers' arrival. Our EMB model is generic and can
   be applied to any real-world bus network system. In particular, we have
   validated the model against the Nanyang Technological University's
   Shuttle Bus System by demonstrating its accuracy in capturing the
   bunching dynamics of the shuttle buses. Furthermore, we have analyzed
   the efficacy of three intervention strategies: holding, no-boarding, and
   centralized-pulsing, against bus bunching by incorporating the rule set
   of these strategies into the model. Under the scenario where the buses
   have the same velocity, we found that all three strategies improve both
   the waiting and travelling times of the commuters. However, when the
   buses have different velocities, only the centralized-pulsing scheme
   consistently outperforms the control scenario where the buses
   periodically bunch together.},

Abstract = {The self-equalizing bus headway control method, as a type of
   headway-based control method, has been proved to resist bus bunching
   effectively. This control method is suitable for use in real-time
   transit operations owing to its simplicity in the formulation and
   solution. However, previous studies paid more attention on the
   demonstration that the bus headways can converge under variable
   conditions, without considering the bus capacity constraint. In
   addition, when the bus capacity constraint is considered, the optimal
   holding time calculation becomes a nonlinear problem instead of a simple
   linear problem. Therefore, in this study, a more precise and
   comprehensive model is proposed to describe the bus operation process.
   An optimal holding time calculation algorithm is proposed to solve the
   nonlinear optimization problem by transforming it into an
   one-dimensional line search problem. The proposed model was validated
   through numerical tests. In the traditional analyses, bus bunching will
   worsen if no additional control method is applied to the bus system.
   However, the present study indicates that bus bunching will be mitigated
   to some extent by the public transit system itself without external
   control at relatively high traffic demand level.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching in public transport is the concentration of similar buses
   having different schedules to a common time point. The reason for this
   phenomenon is variations existing in the bus operation as earliness and
   lateness. Bus bunching has the consequence of reduced service
   reliability concerning both passengers and operators. A zero bunching
   state is vital for enhancing the usage of public transport where the
   buses operate with utmost schedule adherence. Two generally adopted
   strategies for solving bus bunching are a schedule-based strategy which
   provides slack time in a timetable to address late running and fixed
   departure time for the early operations, and a headway-based strategy
   that maintains headway between buses. Bus bunching due to multiple
   origins is a special case in which common tactics cannot effectively
   control a bunching tendency that arises at the entry point. The
   operation schedules of multiple origins must be so designed that a state
   of zero bus bunching can be ensured while buses from different origins
   reach the entry points. This article presents a model of a
   multiple-origins public transport network as a combination of origins,
   routes and entry points, developed in the search for achieving a zero
   bunching state in the operation beyond an entry point. The origins are
   modelled based on the entry-point variables. The routes are modelled
   based on the running time, departure time, arrival time, and dwell time.
   The entry points are modelled based on route and entry-point variables.
   Redesigning route schedules based on the entry-point characteristics and
   an appropriate slack time implementation are proposed and observed to be
   suitable for overcoming bunching in a multiple-origins bus operation.},

Title = {Two-way-looking self-equalizing headway control for bus operations},

Abstract = {Headway variations between successive buses, which lead to bus bunching,
   is undesirable for both passengers and bus operators, instigating longer
   average passenger waiting times and capacity underutilization of buses
   bunched together. Limiting bus bunching, hence, is important for urban
   bus operations. In this study, we analyze a two-way-looking self
   equalizing control method for both deterministic and stochastic running
   times, derive its convergence properties, study the knock-on effect, and
   optimize its control parameter as a function of the number of buses
   operating in the route. By comparing the headways from both upstream and
   downstream of the control point, the control scheme will hold buses, if
   needed, at the control point to gradually restore the common headway of
   the system. By utilizing properties of the headway transition matrices
   associated with the control scheme, we prove that the bus headways will
   self-equalize under deterministic travel time. In addition, under the
   context of stochastic travel time variations, we prove that the headway
   variance of all buses will be reduced to a certain value by the control
   scheme. Further, we analyze the headway control parameter to determine
   its optimal value and adopt the scheme for dynamic control. Finally,
   numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the performance of
   this control scheme, with promising results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This paper proposes a robust dynamic control mechanism for bus transit
   system, taking account of variations in congestion delays and passenger
   demand, and combines bus holding and operating speed control strategies.
   By using a prespecified uncertainty set, we propose a state space model
   for bus motion with delay disturbances and passenger demand
   uncertainties. According to the Lyapunov function analysis method, we
   design a robust dynamic control based on the state-feedback scheme as
   the bus control to achieve the robust stability of the bus transit
   system, which effectively reduces the bus bunching phenomenon.
   Furthermore, we formulate a nonlinear optimal control problem to design
   the robust optimal bus control, which not only reduces the bus bunching,
   but also improves the schedule adherence and headway regularity of bus
   service lines. To handle the complexity of the nonlinear optimal control
   problem with uncertain parameters and disturbances, we reduce it to a
   convex optimization problem by the minimization of an upper bound on the
   objective function. The problem is solved in a polynomial time and
   satisfies the practical real time requirement. Numerical examples are
   presented to validate the effectiveness of the model and control
   methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An approach to improve the operational stability of a bus line by

Abstract = {Bus bunching and the unevenly dispersed buses along a bus line commonly
   appear in an unstable high-frequency bus line system. They will lead to
   unreliable transit service and long waiting times for many passengers.
   To resist bus bunching and improve the stability of a bus line,
   researchers proposed some methods of adjusting the cruising speeds of
   buses. But their methods generally need to adjust the speeds in all road
   segments included in the bus line and sometimes need to coordinate the
   speeds of successively cruising buses. These requirements impede their
   implementations in practice. This paper presents a new strategy to
   overcome the above obstacles by adjusting the speeds of buses in the
   dedicated bus lanes. The regulating speed will be determined by looking
   multiple critical time points ahead to estimate the influence of the
   chosen speed. Numerical experiments show that the new strategy can not
   only stabilize a strongly unstable bus line but also shorten the waiting
   and riding times of passengers. Several insights have also been
   uncovered during numerical analyses. a. The set of regulating speeds
   used by an effective speed adjustment strategy should include refined
   elements and has a wide range for the values of its elements. b. Only
   with nonnegative elements in the above set, the strategy will be out of
   work. c. The more dedicated bus lanes in a bus line, the more effective
   the strategy becomes. The negligible computational time to supply the
   proper regulating speed makes the implementation of our strategy
   practical.},

Abstract = {Schedule-based or headway-based control schemes to reduce bus bunching
   are not resilient because they cannot prevent buses from losing ground
   to the buses they follow when disruptions increase the gaps separating
   them beyond a critical value. (Following buses are then overwhelmed with
   passengers and cannot process their work quick enough to catch up.) This
   critical gap problem can be avoided, however, if buses at the leading
   end of such gaps are given information to cooperate with the ones behind
   by slowing down.
   This paper builds on this idea. It proposes an adaptive control scheme
   that adjusts a bus cruising speed in real-time based on both, its front
   and rear spacings much as if successive bus pairs were connected by
   springs. The scheme is shown to yield regular headways with faster bus
   travel than existing control methods. Its simple and decentralized logic
   automatically compensates for traffic disruptions and inaccurate bus
   driver actions. Its hardware and data requirements are minimal. (C) 2010

Abstract = {This paper presents a model-based multiobjective control strategy to
   reduce bus bunching and hence improve public transport reliability. Our
   goal is twofold. First, we define a proper model, consisting of multiple
   static and dynamic components. Bus-following model captures the
   longitudinal dynamics taking into account the interaction with the
   surrounding traffic. Furthermore, bus stop operations are modeled to
   estimate dwell time. Second, a shrinking horizon model predictive
   controller (MPG) is proposed for solving bus bunching problems. The
   model is able to predict short time-space behavior of public transport
   buses enabling constrained, finite horizon, optimal control solution to
   ensure homogeneity of service both in time and space. In this line, the
   goal with the selected rolling horizon control scheme is to choose a
   proper velocity profile for the public transport bus such that it keeps
   both timetable schedule and a desired headway from the bus in front of
   it (leading bus). The control strategy predicts the arrival time at a
   bus stop using a passenger arrival and dwell time model. In this vein,
   the receding horizon model predictive controller calculates an optimal
   velocity profile based on its current position and desired arrival time.
   Four different weighting strategies are proposed to test (i) timetable
   only, (ii) headway only, (iii) balanced timetable - headway tracking and
   (iv) adaptive control with varying weights. The controller is tested in
   a high fidelity traffic simulator with realistic scenarios. The behavior
   of the system is analyzed by considering extreme disturbances. Finally,
   the existence of a Pareto front between these two objectives is also
   demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Irregular headways could reduce the public transit service level
   heavily. Finding out the exact causes of irregular headways will greatly
   help to develop efficient strategies aiming to improve transit service
   quality. This paper utilizes bus GPS data of Harbin to evaluate the
   headway performance and proposes a statistical method to identify the
   abnormal headways. Association mining is used to dig deeper and
   recognize six causes of bus bunching. The AHP, embedded data analysis,
   is applied to determine the weight of each cause in the case of that
   these causes are combined with each other constantly. Results show that
   the front bus has a greater effect on bus bunching than the following
   bus, and the traffic condition is the most critical factor affecting bus
   headway.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a novel transit data analytics platform for public
   transit planning, assessing service quality and revealing service
   problems in high spatiotemporal resolution for public transit systems
   based on Automatic Passenger Counting (APC) and Automatic Vehicle
   Location (AVL) technologies. The platform offers a systematic way for
   users and decision makers to understand system performance from many
   aspects of service quality, including passenger waiting time,
   stop-skipping frequency, bus bunching level, bus travel time, on-time
   performance, and bus fullness. The AVL-APC data from September 2012 to
   March 2016 were archived in a database to support the development of a
   user-friendly web application that allows both users and managers to
   interactively query bus performance metrics for any bus routes, stops,
   or trips for any time period. This paper demonstrates a case study using
   the platform to examine bus bunching in a transit system operated by the
   Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAAC) in Pittsburgh. It is found
   that the incidence of bus bunching is heavily impacted by the location
   on the route as well as the time of day, and the bunching problem is
   more severe for bus routes operating in mixed traffic than for bus rapid
   transit, which operates along a dedicated busway. Furthermore, a second
   case study is presented with a comprehensive analysis on a
   representative route in Pittsburgh under schedule changes. Suggestions
   for operation of this route to improve service quality are proposed
   based on the data analytics results.},

Abstract = {Buses have an inherent tendency to bunch due to randomness in passenger
   demand and congestion. Many sophisticated control strategies have been
   developed to reduce bus bunching, however, few of them have been
   implemented in high frequency real services. Building upon a control
   strategy comprised of a rolling horizon mathematical programming model
   that yields the optimal holding time that minimizes user-waiting
   times(6), we have developed real-time software and implemented it on two
   bus services in Santiago using different technologies to communicate the
   instructions to bus drivers. The results presented in this paper are
   encouraging, on the days the system was implemented less bus bunching
   was observed, which translated in fewer headway-irregularity fines.
   Moreover lower passenger fare evasion was observed when the bus control
   strategy was used. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Bus transport systems cannot retain scheduled headways without feedback
   control due to their unstable nature, leading to irregularities such as
   bus bunching, and ultimately to increased service times and decreased
   bus service quality. Traditional anti-bunching methods considering only
   regularization of spacings might unnecessarily slow down buses en route.
   In this work a detailed but computationally lightweight dynamical model
   of a single line bus transport system involving both continuous and
   binary states is developed. Furthermore a hybrid model predictive
   control (MPC) scheme is proposed, with a dual objective of regularizing
   spacings and improving speed of bus service operations. Performance of
   the predictive controller is compared with I- and Pl-controllers via
   extensive simulations using the proposed model. Results indicate the
   potential of the hybrid MPC in avoiding bus bunching and decreasing
   passenger delays inside and outside the buses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Comprehensive Approach to Transfer Synchronization in Public Transit},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {146},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The dynamic and uncertain characters of traffic often make bus schedules
   erratic; therefore, planned synchronized public transit transfers do not
   always materialize. This research aims at reducing the operational
   deviation of buses, and thus increasing arrival reliability of vehicles
   as well as improving the occurrence of direct transfer. To achieve this
   objective, a mathematical model is developed to calculate the
   recommended parameters of real-time bus operation strategies according
   to real-time arrival time deviation data. A case study is conducted to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practice.
   Results illustrate that adopting this approach reduces the probability
   of bus bunching from 8.33\% to 0, and increases the operational
   reliability of vehicles, although transit vehicles have a larger delay.
   Moreover, direct transfer can be guaranteed with our proposed approach.},

Title = {Real-time cruising speed design approach for multiline bus systems},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {170},
Pages = {1-24},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this paper, we focus on controlling multiline buses operated in
   networks with curbside bus stops. In such networks, both bus bunching
   and bus queueing, which often result in passenger inconvenience as well
   as bus waiting delays, are frequently observed during bus operations. To
   address the adverse influences of these two phenomena, we propose a
   mixed integer programming (MIP) model to provide guidance on real-time
   bus cruising speeds based on the real-time state of the whole system.
   The proposed model can avoid bus bunching by coordinating bus cruising
   speeds and alleviate bus queueing congestion by restricting the number
   of bus arrivals at each stop. Specifically, to address bus bunching, the
   model has a quadratic objective function that minimizes the total
   expected passenger waiting time; while for bus queueing, the model has
   big-M and time-indexed constraints that restrict the number of bus
   arrivals in each time interval of length g based on the waiting capacity
   Qs of each stop s. Simulation experiments are conducted with different
   sizes of virtual networks, and the corresponding results show that the
   proposed model can lead to both a shorter average passenger waiting time
   and less bus congestion at stops. The improvement with respect to bus
   waiting delay is more significant: the percentage decrease can reach
   46.9\%. Moreover, the results of the average computing time show that
   the control model can be solved before a bus finishes service in most
   cases, which means decisions can be fed back to drivers in a timely
   manner; therefore, the proposed model can meet the requirements of
   real-time control. A sensitivity analysis with respect to parameters Qs
   and g is also performed. These two parameters are shown to only affect
   control performance with respect to bus waiting delays at stops, and
   shorter bus waiting delays can be achieved with relatively small Qs and
   large g. Further experiments are conducted within a real network, and
   the experimental results show that our method is suitable for
   implementation in practice.},

Abstract = {Timetable generation is a subproblem of bus network strategic planning,
   in which the departure time of each trip is determined. We study the bus
   network of Monterrey, Mexico, which is similar to those of other cities
   in Latin America. It is a large bus network where passenger transfers
   must be favored, almost evenly spaced departures are sought, and bus
   bunching of different lines must be avoided. We formulate the
   timetabling problem of this network with the objective of maximizing the
   number of synchronizations to facilitate passenger transfers and avoid
   bus bunching along the network. We define these synchronizations as the
   arrivals of two trips with a separation time within a time window to
   make a flexible formulation. This flexibility is a critical aspect for
   the bus network, since travel times vary because of reasons such as
   driver speed, traffic congestion, and accidents. By proving that our
   problem is NP-hard we answer a 10-year-old open question about the
   NP-hardness of similar problems present in literature. Next, we analyze
   the structural properties of the feasible solution space of our model.
   This analysis leads to a preprocessing stage that eliminates numerous
   decision variables and constraints. Moreover, this preprocessing defines
   feasible synchronization and arrival time windows that are used in a new
   metaheuristic algorithm. Empirical experimentation shows that our
   proposed algorithm obtains high-quality solutions for real-size
   instances in less than one minute. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The bus system is a critical component of sustainable urban
   transportation. However, the operation of a bus fleet is unstable in
   nature, and bus bunching has become a common phenomenon that undermines
   the efficiency and reliability of bus systems. Recently research has
   demonstrated the promising application of multi-agent reinforcement
   learning (MARL) to achieve efficient vehicle holding control to avoid
   bus bunching. However, existing studies essentially overlook the
   robustness issue resulting from perturbations and anomalies in a transit
   system, which is of utmost importance when transferring the models for
   real-world deployment/application. In this study, we integrate implicit
   quantile network and meta-learning to develop a distributional MARL
   framework-IQNC-M-to learn continuous control. The proposed IQNC-M
   framework achieves efficient and reliable control decisions through
   better handling various uncertainties in real-time transit operations.
   Specifically, we introduce an interpretable meta-learning module to
   incorporate global information into the distributional MARL framework,
   which is an effective solution to circumvent the credit assignment issue
   in the transit system. In addition, we design a specific learning
   procedure to train each agent within the framework to pursue a robust
   control policy. We develop simulation environments based on real-world
   bus services and passenger demand data and evaluate the proposed
   framework against both traditional holding control models and
   state-of-the-art MARL models. Our results show that the proposed IQNC-M
   framework can effectively handle the general perturbations and various
   extreme events, such as traffic state perturbations and demand surges,
   thus improving both efficiency and reliability of the transit system.},

Abstract = {The bus is inevitably affected by various factors during the trip, which
   causes that the phenomenon of bus bunching often occurs. This paper
   proposed a nonlinear optimal control model with passenger demand and
   disturbance uncertainties for the real-time bus regulation in urban
   rapid transit. The aim of this model is to assure the stability of bus
   headway in the line, reduce passengers' waiting time and improve bus
   service level. Considering the system uncertainties and the real-time
   control requirement of bus regulation, a robust optimal predictive
   control algorithm is put forward to generate the real-time optimal bus
   regulation strategy based on updated delay feedback of buses by a
   rolling horizon strategy. Simultaneously, by using continuous interval
   number to describe the uncertain parameters, the robust counterpart of
   the formulated robust optimization model is obtained using the duality
   theory, which is further converted to a mixed integer convex quadratic
   programming problem by a linearization method, which can be easily
   solved to obtain the robust solution with a good performance for any
   value of uncertain parameters. Finally, some numerical experiments are
   conducted to verify the validity of the presented optimization model in
   improving the stability of the bus headway.},

Abstract = {This work proposes a periodic bus holding control method where the bus
   holding times of all running trips are computed simultaneously within
   each optimization time period; thus, increasing the coordination among
   running buses for avoiding bus bunching. This paper considers the
   adverse effects of the bus holding control in the in-vehicle travel
   times of on-board passengers and performs holistic bus holding decisions
   by modelling the bus holding problem as a discrete, nonlinear,
   constrained optimization problem. Given the computational complexity of
   the bus holding problem, an alternating minimization approach is
   introduced for computing the optimal holding times at each optimization
   instance. The performance of the periodic control method is evaluated
   against the performance of event-based control methods using 5-month
   automated vehicle location and automated passenger count data from bus
   line 1 in Stockholm for contacting simulation-based experiments.},

Abstract = {Scheduled public transport (PT) service on a defined network often
   encounters unforeseen variations of arrival times mainly because of
   traffic problems, unexpected passenger demand, and driver behavior.
   These variations will create the undesirable vehicle (particularly bus)
   bunching phenomenon unless a proper control action is introduced. This
   study develops a methodology to attain optimally real-time control
   actions to minimize the bunching phenomenon. To this end, a
   ``library{''} of selected operational tactics is constructed, for the PT
   operators, not only to assist in reducing vehicle bunching but also to
   increase the likelihood of direct (without await) transfers. The library
   of operational tactics serves as a basis for a process of real-time
   control actions to maintain the scheduled headway and thus achieving
   maximal transfer synchronization. The methodology developed, using
   simulation, is applied to a case study of actual bus routes operated in
   the region of Auckland, New Zealand. The results imply what tactic to
   use in real time, what is the optimal control strength, and what is the
   saving of riding and waiting times in comparison with PT operation
   without using tactics. The findings show that a significant improvement,
   in avoiding bunching and increasing the number of direct transfers, is
   attained by the use of a combination of selected tactics.},

Abstract = {To solve the problems of bus bunching and large gaps, this study
   combines bus holding and speed adjusting to alleviate them respectively
   considering the characteristics of passenger's perceived waiting time.
   The difference between passenger's perceived waiting time at stops and
   actual time is described quantitatively through the expected waiting
   time of passengers. Bus holding based on a threshold method is
   implemented at any stops for bunching buses, and speed adjusting based
   on a Markovian decision model is implemented at limited stops for
   lagging buses. Simulations based on real data of a bus route show that
   the integrated control strategy is able to improve the service
   reliability and to decrease passengers' perceived waiting time at stops.
   Several insights have been uncovered through performance analysis: (1)
   The increase of holding control strength results in improvement of the
   headway regularity, and leads to a greater perceived waiting time
   though; (2) Compared to traveling freely, suitable speed guidance will
   not slow down the average cruising speed in the trip; (3) The scale of
   passenger demand and through passengers are the two key factors
   influencing whether a stop should be selected as a speed-adjusting
   control point.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching deteriorates transit service quality and passengers'
   experience. The modeling and prediction of bus operation states are
   essential for improving the quality of transit service. Due to the
   nature of traffic evolution and state transition, bunching-oriented
   modeling based on bus operation state is more intuitive when compared
   with the headway-based modeling approach. This work explicitly predicted
   bus operation state by modeling the dynamic evolution of different
   states. Five different bus operation states were defined and classified
   by the K-means algorithm, and the dynamic state evolution was formulated
   as a Markov chain model. Finally, a multinomial logistic model was
   developed to predict the bus operation state. A case study was designed
   to test the performance of the proposed model based on the Global
   Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data collected from four bus routes
   in Xi'an, China. The results showed that the proposed model was able to
   accurately predict the bus operation states.},

Abstract = {In an uncontrolled bus line, buses tend to bunch due to the stochastic
   nature of traffic flow and passenger demand at bus stops. Although bus
   holding has been shown to effectively prevent bus bunching, this control
   method often fails when disturbances are large and frequent. A
   coordinated control method combining two control means (bus holding and
   stop-skipping) is proposed instead of using only one control means. Bus
   holding and stop-skipping are integrated with the concept of predictive
   control. Considering the conciseness and convenience in applications,
   herein, we propose an analytical method to automatically equalize bus
   headways in a single line by analyzing bus headways between both its
   leading and following buses, as well as the number of waiting passengers
   at the bus stops. Numerical tests conducted in a simplified scenario and
   random scenario show that the proposed coordinated control method
   performs better in terms of headway convergence rate and resisting
   random disturbance than using bus holding only. Moreover, a set of
   simulation tests based on an actual bus route showed better performance
   of the proposed coordinated control method with increasing demand in
   terms of regulating the bus headway, saving the total travel time, and
   providing reliable service for passengers.},

Abstract = {The holding strategy performs well in resisting bus bunching in the
   dedicated bus route. Yet, its efficiency in a non-dedicated bus route
   has not been well studied, and its external effects on other road
   participants are unclear. We study this topic in a circular two-lane
   traffic system consisting of buses and cars. A cellular automaton model
   is used to depict the vehicles' dynamic behaviors. By numerical
   simulations, we obtained the phase diagram of the bus system, and
   identified the four states concerning the stability and level of
   service. Then we analyzed the flow and velocity characteristics and
   distinguished three states of the traffic system. Our simulations prove
   the separation effect of car flows on the bus headway regulation.
   Combined with this effect, the holding strategy makes the bus running
   more homogeneous and the bus utilization more evenly in the mixed
   traffic flow condition. Interestingly, from a macro perspective, the
   holding strategy incurs no detrimental effects on the whole traffic
   system, though it might intensify local interference between buses and
   cars near bus stops. Under certain conditions, the average speed of
   buses and cars increases, eventually increasing the system's
   capacity.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Does the measured performance of bus operators depend on the index
   chosen to assess reliability in contracts? An analysis of bus headway
   variability},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {90},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The choice of performance indicators in bus contracts is a complex
   problem for public transport regulators and financial incentives to
   provide a reliable service have been designed by several agencies. We
   study the issue of bus headway variability, focusing on headway
   variability at bus dispatching, which is a very relevant issue that has
   not been properly analysed in existing studies, despite the considerable
   influence of irregular dispatching on bus bunching. We identify the
   variables that are statistically significant in explaining bus headway
   variability at the beginning of routes, using large GPS and smartcard
   databases of all bus routes in Santiago, Chile. Three measures of
   headway variability are used: standard deviation, modified index per
   observation and an ad-hoc measure included in the Santiago bus
   contracts, called `minutes of incidence'. Significant variables to
   explain headway variability are bus frequency, number of bus services
   per terminal, distance from the bus depot to the first stop, route
   length, bus demand and operating speed. The measured performance of each
   bus operator is different depending on the headway variability indicator
   used, which points to the relevance of choosing an appropriate index of
   service reliability as a financial incentive in contracts. Implications
   for service planning are discussed.},

Title = {Bus control strategies in corridors with signalized intersections},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a new dynamic bus control strategy aimed at reducing
   the negative effects of time-headway variations on route performance,
   based on real-time bus tracking data at stops. In routes with high
   demand, any delay of a single vehicle ends up causing an unstable motion
   of buses and producing the bus bunching phenomena. This strategy
   controls the cruising speed of buses and considers the extension of the
   green phase of traffic lights at intersections, when a bus is
   significantly delayed. The performance of this strategy will be compared
   to the current static operation technique based on the provision of
   slack times at holding points. An operational model is presented in
   order to estimate the effects of each controlling strategy, taking into
   account the vehicle capacity constraint. Control strategies are assessed
   in terms of passenger total travel time, operating cost as well as on
   the coefficient of headway variation. The effects of controlling
   strategies are tested in an idealized bus route under different
   operational settings and in the bus route of highest demand in Barcelona
   by simulation. The results show that the proposed dynamic controlling
   strategy reduces total system cost (user and agency) by 15-40\% as well
   as the coefficient of headway variation 53-78\% regarding the
   uncontrolled case, providing a bus performance similar to the expected
   when time disturbance is not presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {On high-frequency routes, buses tend to bunch together, creating gaps in
   service and causing undue passenger waiting time. There are many
   approaches to solving the bus bunching problem in the literature but
   there lacks empirical analysis on practical implementation. In this
   study, a real-time holding method from the literature was implemented on
   three high-frequency transit routes, the Atlanta Streetcar and the
   Georgia Tech Red Route in Atlanta, GA, and the VIA Route 100 in San
   Antonio, TX. The performance of the method was evaluated in terms of
   headway stability, holding time, and mean passenger waiting time. The
   method was found to improve headway stability compared to the schedule,
   but required longer holds in some cases. Overall, the holding method
   reduced the waiting time of passengers at stops in all three case
   studies. The challenges associated with location data quality,
   prediction accuracy, the human element and the surrounding environment
   are discussed and strategies to address them are recommended.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching affects transit operations by increasing passenger waiting
   times and its variability. This work proposes a new mathematical
   programming model to control vehicles operating on a transit corridor
   minimizing total delays. The model can handle a heterogeneous fleet of
   vehicles with different capacities without using binary variables, which
   make solution times compatible with real-time requirements. Two control
   policies are studied within a rolling horizon framework: (i) vehicle
   holding (HRT), which can be applied at any stop and (ii) holding
   combined with boarding limits (HBLRT), in which the number of boarding
   passengers at any stop can be limited in order to increase operational
   speed. Both strategies are evaluated in a simulation environment under
   different operational conditions. The results show that HBLRT and HRT
   outperform other benchmark control strategies in all scenarios, with
   savings of excess waiting time of up to 77\% and very low variability in
   performance. HBLRT shows significant benefits in relation to HRT only
   under short headway operation and high passenger demand. Moreover, our
   results suggest implementing boarding limits only when the next arriving
   vehicle is nearby. Interestingly, in these cases HBLRT not only reduces
   an extra 6.3\% the expected waiting time in comparison with HRT, but
   also outperforms other control schemes in terms of comfort and
   reliability to both passengers and operators. To passengers HBLRT
   provide a more balanced load factor across vehicles yielding a more
   comfortable experience. To operators the use of boarding limits speed up
   vehicles reducing the average cycle time and its variability, which is
   key for a smooth operation at terminals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {A predictive headway-based bus-holding strategy with dynamic control
   point selection: A cooperative game theory approach},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL},

Pages = {29-51},

Abstract = {Bus holding is a widely used control method to regularize bus headways
   and reduce bus bunching. The method works in such a way by delaying
   buses at control points if their departure times or headways deviate
   from the planned ones. However, it may result in reduced bus commercial
   speeds and increased passenger onboard travel time. To avoid this
   problem, researchers have suggested that control points be spaced
   cautiously along the route such that only a few are needed. This study
   proposes a predictive headway based bus holding strategy with dynamic
   control point importance ranking and selection based on the cooperative
   game theory. The framework considers not only individual control points'
   impact but also the collective group control effects. Specifically, the
   proposed framework consists of two components: a performance model and a
   cooperative game model. The performance model predicts headway
   performances of all running buses when different control point
   combinations are in effect. Dynamic bus running times and passenger
   demands are reflected in the model. Then, these headway performances are
   passed to the cooperative game model with control points being players
   and improvements in headway performances compared with that under no
   holding control being the utility function. The game is solved by
   Myerson value, a concept that extends Shapley value used for the normal
   cooperative game and considers the cooperation structure and potential
   worth of coalitions. We use Myerson value to rank the importance of
   control points on regularizing headways, as it measures the average
   marginal utility contribution of a control point to all possible
   coalitions that exclude that point. We prove that Myerson value lies in
   the Omega-core of the game and thus satisfies allocation efficiency,
   individual and coalition rationality. The proposed framework is applied
   to target headway control and two-way-looking self equalizing headway
   control. Simulation results show that the framework can significantly
   reduce passenger waiting time and bus headway variation. (C) 2019

Title = {Two-Way Cooperative Priority Control of Bus Transit with Stop Capacity
   Constraint},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Signal priority control and speed guidance are effective ways to reduce
   the delay of buses at intersections. Previous work generally focused on
   the optimization strategy at the intersection area, without
   simultaneously considering the influence on adjacent downstream bus
   stops. This probably leads to the size of the passed bus platoon
   exceeding the capacity of berths and queuing, which in turn causes
   additional delay to the overall bus travel time. Focusing on this
   problem, this paper proposes a two-way cooperative control strategy that
   constrains the size of the upstream platoon. Besides this, to avoid bus
   bunching, no more than two buses from the same route can be admitted in
   the same platoon. Based on these principles, we modeled how to make
   buses pass without stopping by simultaneously considering the signal
   control and speed guidance. Finally, the effectiveness was validated by
   simulation in Verkehr in Stadten Simulation (VISSIM, German for
   ``Traffic in cities-simulation{''}), a microscopic traffic simulator.
   The results show that compared to the existing methods, which only use
   signal control, the cooperative strategy reduces the total delay at the
   intersection and the downstream stop. It alleviates the queuing
   phenomenon at the downstream bus stop greatly, and the bus arrivals tend
   to be more uniform, which helps improve the reliability and
   sustainability of bus services.},

Abstract = {On high-frequency routes, transit agencies hold buses at control points
   and seek to dispatch them with even headways to avoid bus bunching. This
   paper compares holding methods used in practice and recommended in the
   literature using simulated and historical data from Tri-Met route 72 in
   Portland, Oregon. We evaluated the performance of each holding method in
   terms of headway instability and mean holding time. We tested the
   sensitivity of holding methods to their parameterization and to the
   number of control points. We found that Schedule-Based methods require
   little holding time but are unable to stabilize headways even when
   applied at a high control point density. The Headway-Based methods are
   able to successfully control headways but they require long holding
   times. Prediction-Based methods achieve the best compromise between
   headway regularity and holding time on a wide range of desired
   trade-offs. Finally, we found the prediction-based methods to be
   sensitive to prediction accuracy, but using an existing prediction
   method we were able to minimize this sensitivity. These results can be
   used to inform the decision of transit agencies to implement holding
   methods on routes similar to TriMet 72. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {An optimization-based speed-control method for high frequency buses
   serving curbside stops},

Abstract = {In this paper, an optimization-based speed-control method is proposed to
   alleviate the adverse effects of bus bunching. This method specifically
   focuses on one-way line transit corridors with curbside stops and high
   frequency buses. In such public transit corridors, holding buses at
   stops may not be suitable for implementation. Instead of holding, we
   choose to control bus cruising speeds between stops. The relationship
   between holding and speed-control is discussed. A conventional holding
   model M0 as well as a model M1, that determines travel times between
   stops, are considered. In order to make control decisions easy to
   understand as well as to follow, an improved speed-control model M2 is
   also proposed. All the models allow for control decisions based on the
   real-time state of the entire system. The three models are programmed in
   a rolling horizon scheme within a simulation system. Simulation
   experiments are conducted to examine these models in different scenarios
   associated with different levels of traffic randomness. The
   corresponding results show that, when the traffic is highly variable,
   the speed-control method can reduce average passenger waiting time by
   more than 23\% while the holding method results in an average passenger
   waiting time that is almost 2 min longer than when using the
   speed-control method. So the speed-control model is shown to be more
   suitable for implementation in practice. Four strategies that can
   generate more driver-friendly control decisions are further proposed and
   tested. The practical applications of the proposed speed-control models
   are discussed.},

Title = {Analysis of real-time control strategies in a corridor with multiple bus
   services},

Abstract = {Control strategies have been widely used in the literature to counteract
   the effects of bus bunching in passenger's waiting times and its
   variability. These strategies have only been studied for the case of a
   single bus line in a corridor. However, in many real cases this
   assumption does not hold. Indeed, there are many transit corridors with
   multiple bus lines interacting, and this interaction affects the
   efficiency of the implemented control mechanism.
   This work develops an optimization model capable of executing a control
   scheme based on holding strategy for a corridor with multiple bus lines.
   We analyzed the benefits in the level of service of the public transport
   system when considering a central operator who wants to maximize the
   level of service for users of all the bus lines, versus scenarios where
   each bus line operates independently. A simulation was carried out
   considering two medium frequency bus lines that serve a set of stops and
   where these two bus lines coexist in a given subset of stops. In the
   simulation we compared the existence of a central operator, using the
   optimization model we developed, against the independent operation of
   each line.
   In the simulations the central operator showed a greater reduction in
   the overall waiting time of the passengers of 55\% compared to a no
   control scenario. It also provided a balanced load of the buses along
   the corridor, and a lower variability of the bus headways in the subset
   of stops where the lines coexist, thus obtaining better reliability for
   all types of passengers present in the public transport system. (C) 2015

Title = {No-boarding buses: agents allowed to cooperate or defect},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We study a bus system with a no-boarding policy, where a `slow' bus may
   disallow passengers from boarding if it meets some criteria. When the
   no-boarding policy is activated, people waiting to board at the bus stop
   are given the choices of cooperating or defecting. The people's
   heterogeneous behaviours are modelled by inductive reasoning and bounded
   rationality, inspired by the El Farol problem and the minority game. In
   defecting the no-boarding policy, instead of the minority group being
   the winning group, we investigate several scenarios where defectors win
   if the number of defectors does not exceed the maximum number of allowed
   defectors but lose otherwise. Contrary to the classical minority game
   which has N agents repeatedly playing amongst themselves, many
   real-world situations like boarding a bus involves only a subset of
   agents who `play each round', with different subsets playing at
   different rounds. We find for such realistic situations, there is no
   phase transition with no herding behaviour when the usual control
   paramater 2(m)/N is small. The absence of the herding behaviour assures
   feasible and sustainable implementation of the no-boarding policy with
   allowance for defections, without leading to bus bunching.},

Abstract = {The problems of bus bunching mitigation and the energy management of
   groups of vehicles have traditionally been treated separately in the
   literature and been formulated in two different frameworks. The present
   work bridges this gap by formulating the optimal control problem of the
   bus line eco-driving and regularity control as a smooth, multi-objective
   nonlinear program. Since this nonlinear program has only a few coupling
   variables, it is shown how it can be solved in parallel aboard each bus,
   such that only a marginal amount of computations need to be carried out
   centrally. This procedure leverages the structure of the bus line by
   enabling parallel computations and reducing the communication loads
   between the buses, which makes the problem resolution scalable in terms
   of the number of buses. Closed-loop control is then achieved by
   embedding this procedure in a model predictive control. Stochastic
   simulations based on real passengers and travel times data are realized
   for several scenarios with different levels of bunching for a line of
   electric buses. Our method achieves fast recoveries to regular headways
   as well as energy savings of up to 9.3\% when compared with traditional
   holding or speed control baselines.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching is an instability problem where buses operating on
   high-frequency public transport lines arrive at stops in bunches. This
   work unveils that bus-following models can be used to design bus-to-bus
   cooperative control strategies and mitigate bunching. The use of
   bus-following models avoids the explicit modelling of bus-stops, which
   would render the resulting problem discrete, with events occurring at
   arbitrary time intervals. In a follow-the-leader two-bus system,
   bus-to-bus communication allows the driver of the following bus to
   observe (from a remote distance) the position and speed of the leading
   bus operating in the same transport line. The information transmitted
   from the leader is then used to control the speed of the follower to
   eliminate bunching. A platoon of buses operating in the same transit
   line can be then controlled as leader-follower dyads. In this context,
   we propose practical control laws to regulate speeds, which would lead
   to bunching cure. A combined state estimation and remote control scheme
   is developed to capture the effect of disturbances and randomness in
   passenger arrivals. To investigate the performance of the developed
   schemes the 9-km 1-California line in San Francisco with about 50
   arbitrary spaced bus stops is used. Simulations with empirical passenger
   data are carried out. Results show bunching avoidance and improvements
   in terms of schedule reliability of bus services and delays. The
   proposed control is robust, scalable in terms of transit network size,
   and thus easy to deploy by transit agencies to improve communication and
   guidance to drivers, and reduce costs.},

Title = {Scheduling Synchronization for Overlapping Segments in Bus Lines: Speed
   Control and Green Extension Strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Overlapping bus lines are ubiquitous in bus networks, particularly in
   metropolitan areas. The overlapping of bus lines can provide convenience
   for passengers who wish to transfer. However, it also tends to cause bus
   bunching at overlapping segment stops. Moreover, overlapping of bus
   lines introduces additional complexity to the operation of bus systems.
   This study aimed to dispatch bus vehicles entering overlapping segments
   dynamically by adopting speed control and green light extension
   strategies. This ensures that transferring passengers experience less
   transfer waiting time and reduced bus bunching at overlapping segments.
   The proposed model considers environmental constraints on vehicle speed
   and the stochastic factors of passenger arrivals at a stop.
   Synchronization is maximized by controlling the speed of vehicles along
   a roadway and determining whether a green light extension strategy is
   enabled. The effectiveness of the proposed model was verified by
   applying it to a real overlapping segment in Harbin, China. The results
   demonstrate that the proposed model can more than double the opportunity
   for synchronization in overlapping segments while reducing bus bunching
   at the stops in overlapping segments.},

Abstract = {The bus bunching problem caused by the uncertain interstation travel
   time and passenger demand rate is a critical issue that impairs transit
   efficiency. Most current bus control studies focus on single or combined
   strategies while ignoring the bus system's real-time environmental
   information. This paper proposed a distributed deep reinforcement
   learning (DRL)-based generic bus dynamic control method to solve the bus
   bunching problem by maintaining the schedule adherence, headway
   regularity, and achieving the consensus in the multiagent system. This
   study built a bus system that utilizes the bus historical and traffic
   information by incorporating these characteristics into the environment.
   After that, a distributed DRL-based bus dynamic control strategy is
   developed based on the bus system, enabling each bus to adjust its
   motion by any generic method utilizing the weighted downstream buses'
   information. Regarding the training process, a distributed proximal
   policy optimization algorithm is adopted for improving the converging
   performance. Simulated experiments are conducted to verify the control
   performance, robustness, feasibility, resilience, and generalization
   capability, which shows that our strategy can significantly reduce the
   schedule and headway deviations, prevent the accumulation of deviation
   downstream, and avoid bus bunching.},

Abstract = {Randomness affecting the operation of public transport systems generates
   significant increments in waiting times. A strategy to deal with this
   randomness is bus injection, in which buses are kept in specific points
   along the route ready to be dispatched when an event such as an
   extremely long headway occurs. In this work, a stochastic model based on
   the second moment of the headways distribution is developed to determine
   if one or more buses are worth reserving for injection in a public
   transport service. A single stop approach is initially used to determine
   an expression for the optimal headway threshold triggering the
   injection. Then, a model for the complete service is developed and used
   to determine when the empty bus should be injected within the headway
   once the decision to inject it has been taken. We show that the bus
   should be injected approximately when 57\% of the headway has passed.
   Simulations with real data are used to test the proposed model, proving
   its accuracy in terms of measuring the impact on waiting times. The
   results show that reserving a bus to be injected can be better than
   operating the entire fleet continuously.},

Abstract = {In uncontrolled bus systems, buses tend to bunch due to the stochastic
   nature of traffic flows and passenger demand at bus stops. Although
   schedules and priori target methods introduce sladc time to delay buses
   at control points to maintain constant headways between successive
   buses, too much slack required delay passengers on-board. In addition,
   these methods focus on regular headways and do not consider the rates of
   convergence of headways after disturbances. We propose a self-adaptive
   control scheme to equalize the headways of buses with little slack in a
   single line automatically. The proposed method only requires the
   information from the current bus at the control point and both its
   leading and following buses. This elegant method is shown to regulate
   headways faster than existing methods. In addition, compared to previous
   self-equalizing methods, the proposed method can improve the travel time
   of buses by about 12\%, while keeping the waiting time of passengers
   almost the same. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Bus operations, due to their unstable nature, are inefficient when left
   uncontrolled with respect to retaining headways. Irregularities such as
   bus bunching lead to loss of time and decrease bus service quality.
   Development of bus transport system management schemes to avoid bus
   bunching and improve performance are of high importance, and has thus
   been the focus of many works in the public transport systems literature.
   Motivated by the importance of developing bus control strategies for
   improving performance, and specifically by the lack of a detailed but
   computationally efficient mathematical model describing bus transport
   system dynamics in the literature (which can facilitate model-based
   control design), we propose a mixed logical dynamical model of a single
   loop bus transport system, which involves both continuous (e.g., bus
   positions) and binary (e.g., the state of a bus regarding whether it is
   holding at a certain stop or not) states. Furthermore, we develop a
   hybrid model predictive control scheme with actuation via bus speeds,
   which can regularize headways and improve bus service quality.
   Performance of the predictive controller is evaluated via simulation
   experiments using the proposed model, where the passenger demands and
   maximum bus speeds are extracted from data collected from the bus
   network of the city of Fribourg. Results indicate the potential of the
   proposed controller in avoiding bus bunching and decreasing passenger
   travel times. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic

Abstract = {In this paper, results of an evaluation of an innovative strategy for
   minimizing bus bunching are presented. The strategy involves continuous
   monitoring of bus positions along their route and controlling bus
   spacing when necessary by employing signal priority and bus holding
   actions. The evaluation exercise aims to establish traffic and bus
   operating conditions when the strategy performs best. A simulation model
   of a hypothetical bus route developed using a PARAMICS (Parallel
   Microscopic Simulator) is used for this purpose. Bus bunching, measured
   in terms of disruptions to headways, is found to increase with decreases
   in design headway, increases in route length, and increases in traffic
   congestion. When bus spacing is controlled, a significant improvement is
   seen in cases of shorter design headways of 5 and 10 min, resulting in
   80\% of cases having more than 10\% reduction in excess waiting time and
   60\% of the cases having more than 20\% reduction in excess waiting
   time.},

Abstract = {Bus route performance, typically expressed in terms of excess waiting
   time (EWT), is often unstable and suffers from bunching which results in
   lower regularity. Governments are introducing regularity-based contracts
   for operators, where monetary incentives or penalties are introduced
   depending on performance. Optimization of bus regularity requires the
   recursive coordination of several buses, hindering the solution
   scalability in real-time.
   In this work we propose a bus headway balancer based on stochastic
   search and branch hopping/merging algorithm which optimizes schedules to
   minimize the EWT. This algorithm balances bus headway deviations by
   introducing dwell intervals in the schedule, which can be applied off
   line or in real-time. A test-case implementation of the approach used
   3-month AVL data from a bus operator in Asia and showcased an
   improvement of EWT by up to 50\% with reduction in computational
   complexity to almost linear time and at least 2x times increase at
   solution space search.},

Title = {Operation of transit corridors served by two routes: Physical design,
   synchronization, and control strategies},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {130},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many transit network layouts require the operation of multiple routes
   along a common transit segment in the busiest area of the city. At some
   points, these routes branch out to provide spatial coverage to the city
   periphery. These schemes allow more efficient deployment of resources at
   the expense of introducing more complexity into the system operation.
   This study aims to determine the effect of the branched layout of a
   corridor, demand distribution and traffic lights on the total cost of
   the system as well as its service regularity. The transit corridor is
   operated by buses, although it can be generalized for other transit
   modes. An operational model to estimate the travel and waiting time of
   users and the performance of buses on each route segment is developed.
   The model considers the stochastic effect of the passenger arrivals at
   stops and vehicle acceleration-deceleration rates. An optimization
   procedure to determine the optimal headway and relative synchronization
   of routes, which minimizes the total cost incurred by transit agencies
   and users or the headway variations in the common route segment, is
   introduced. Furthermore, a performance evaluation of bus control
   strategies based on a combination of holding points and green extensions
   at traffic signals in the H10 cross-town corridor of Barcelona's new bus
   network is presented.},

Title = {An Online Optimal Bus Signal Priority Strategy to Equalise Headway in
   Real-Time},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Bus bunching is a severe problem that affects the service levels of
   public transport systems. Most of the previous studies in the field of
   Bus Signal Priority (BSP) and Transit Signal Priority (TSP) focus on
   reducing a bus delay at signalised intersections and ignore the
   importance of balancing the bus headways. However, since general BSP
   methods allocate uneven priorities for individual buses, the headways of
   bus sequences are prioritised or delayed randomly, increasing the
   likelihood of bus bunching. To address this problem and to improve the
   reliability of bus services, we propose an online optimisation model to
   determine the signal duration and splits for each traffic intersection
   and each signal cycle for bus priority. The proposed model is able to
   induce the signal timing back to a baseline when the BSP request
   frequency is low. Using the proposed model, a statistically significant
   reduction of 10.0\% was achieved for bus headway deviation and 6.4\% for
   passenger waiting times. The simulation-based evaluation results also
   indicate that the proposed model does not affect the efficiency of bus
   services and other vehicles significantly.},

Title = {Dynamic bus substitution strategy for bunching intervention},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Bus headways are typically susceptible to external disturbances (e.g.,
   due to traffic congestion, clustered passenger arrivals, and special
   passenger needs), which create gaps in the system that grow eventually
   into bunching. Although many control strategies, such as static and
   dynamic holding strategies, have been implemented to mitigate the
   effects of unreliable bus schedules, most of them would impose longer
   dwell times on the passengers. In this paper, we investigate the
   potential of an alternative bus substitution strategy that is currently
   implemented by some transit agencies in an ad-hoc manner. In this
   strategy, the agency deploys a fleet of standby buses to take over
   service from any early or late buses so as to contain deviations from
   schedule, and the intention is to impose minimum penalties on the
   onboard passengers. We develop a discrete-time infinite-horizon
   approximate dynamic programming approach to find the optimal policy to
   minimize the overall agency and passenger costs. It is shown through
   numerical examples that schedule deviations can be controlled by
   regularly inserting standby buses as substitutions. In some
   implementation scenarios, the proposed strategy holds the potential to
   achieve comparable performance with some of the most advanced
   strategies, and to outperform the conventional slack-based schedule
   control scheme. In light of the emerging opportunities associated with
   autonomous driving, the performance of the proposed strategy can become
   even stronger due to the reduction in costs for keeping the fleet of
   standby buses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Schedule instability adversely affects the performance of bus transport
   systems. Bus bunching and similar irregularities decrease quality of bus
   services and increase travel times. In this regard, bus system
   management schemes are of high importance. Motivated by the potential
   impact of developing advanced bus control schemes on transportation
   practice, in this paper a hybrid model predictive control scheme with
   actuation via bus speeds is developed, which can regularize headways and
   improve bus service quality. The controller extends upon earlier work by
   considering detailed dynamics of the interactions between buses and
   stops via passenger flows. Performance of the controller is compared
   with a no control case and a PI controller via simulation experiments,
   conducted with a recently proposed mixed logical dynamical bus loop
   model involving both continuous (e.g., bus positions) and binary (e.g.,
   the state of a bus regarding whether it is holding at a certain stop or
   not) states. Results showcase the capability of the proposed controller
   in regularizing headways, avoiding bus bunching and decreasing passenger
   travel times.},

Abstract = {Headway fluctuation and bus bunching are common in transit operations,
   while holding control is a proven strategy for the reduction of bus
   bunching. Recently, benefited from the advances in technology and tools,
   adaptive control method for equalising bus headways on the bus route
   gradually has become successful. Although this method performs well in
   regulating the bus operation, it does not consider the impact of the
   number of buses on the bus route. The control method may fail to
   regulate bus headways due to an insufficient number of buses, despite
   the control method itself being effective. Therefore, this paper
   explores the relationship between the number of buses on the bus route
   and the performance of the self-equalise bus headway control method. A
   model is proposed to search the suitable number of buses on the bus
   route by analysing the changes of the bus headway standard deviations
   with increasing the number of buses. Furthermore, a set of numerical
   tests were conducted. According to the results of the analysis, under
   high demand, the performance of the self-equalise bus headway control
   method is more sensitive to changes of bus number on the bus route.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a multi-modal framework for modelling and analysing
   different headway control strategies for improving bus service
   regularity. The interaction between buses and their surrounding traffic
   is captured in a multi-modal system through a Hamilton-Jacobi
   formulation of kinematic wave model. This paper further presents a set
   of signal-based strategies which regulate bus headway through adjusting
   signal timing plans. The results reveal that the capability of
   regulating bus headway disturbances through utilising traffic signals is
   important for maximising bus service regularity and coordinating the bus
   dynamics with surrounding traffic. This study generates new insights on
   managing bus reliability and multi-modal traffic in busy urban networks.},

Abstract = {The most relevant issues related to headway variability in public
   transport planning, operations and quality of service are reviewed in
   this paper. We discuss the causes and consequences of headway
   variability, the alternative metrics that have been proposed to measure
   it, the preventive and reactive strategies to control headway
   variability in both research and practice, including the role of drivers
   and of present and future technology, and how service provision
   contracts might deal with headway variability through metrics and
   financial incentives. The most influential elements that explain headway
   variability along a route are the irregularity at which vehicles are
   dispatched, the scheduled frequency, the distance travelled or route
   length, the passenger demand and associated dwell times, and the number
   of stops. We conclude that there is a large gap between the
   state-of-the-art and the state-of-practice in terms of identification of
   headway variability issues, as well as in the development of mitigation
   and control measures. It is therefore paramount that future research
   will contribute to closing this gap by addressing organisational,
   contractual and technological barriers in the implementation of measures
   aimed at mitigating headway variability in public transport services.},

Abstract = {In high-frequency bus services, maintaining the service regularity is a
   critical issue. The service regularityis directly related to the
   excessive waiting times (EWT) of passengers atbus stops. In a regular
   service, the EWT isminimized resulting in even headways between
   consecutive buses of the same line. In this study, we propose the
   combined use of rescheduling and busholding to improve passengers'
   excessive waiting times. We model the dynamic rescheduling and bus
   holding problem as an integer nonlinear program (INLP) and we prove its
   NP-hardness. Our model considers the constraints of the original
   timetable e an issue that is usually neglected from most dynamic control
   methods. Given the NP-hardness of our mathematical program, we introduce
   a problem-specific heuristic to explore efficiently the solution space.
   The convergence rate of the proposed heuristic is tested against other
   solution methods, including simulated annealing with linear cooling,
   hill climbing and branch and bound with multi-start sequential quadratic
   programming. In addition, simulations with the use of actual operational
   data from a major bus operator in Asia Pacific demonstrate an up to 35\%
   potential EWT improvement for aminor increase of 6\% to the travel times
   of onboard passengers. (C) 2021 Periodical Offices of Chang'an

Title = {Improving Bus Operations through Integrated Dynamic Holding Control and
   Schedule Optimization},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION},
Year = {2018},
Abstract = {Bus bunching can lead to unreliable bus services if not controlled
   properly. Passengers will suffer from the uncertainty of travel time and
   the excessive waiting time. Existing dynamic holding strategies to
   address bus bunching have two major limitations. First, existing models
   often rely on large slack time to ensure the validity of the underlying
   model. Such large slack time can significantly reduce the bus operation
   efficiency by increasing the overall route travel times. Second, the
   existing holding strategies rarely consider the impact on the schedule
   planning. Undesirable results such as bus overloading issues arise when
   the bus fleet size is limited. This paper explores analytically the
   relationship between the slack time and the effect of holding control.
   The optimal slack time determined based on the derived relationship is
   found to be ten times smaller than in previous models based on numerical
   simulation results. An optimization model is developed with
   passenger-orient objective function in terms of travel cost and
   constraints such as fleet size limit, layover time at terminals, and
   other schedule planning factors. The optimal choice of control stops,
   control parameters, and slack time can be achieved by solving the
   optimization. The proposed model is validated with a case study
   established based on field data collected from Chengdu, China. The
   numerical simulation uses the field passenger demand, bus average travel
   time, travel time variance of road segments, and signal timings. Results
   show that the proposed model significantly reduce passengers average
   travel time compared with existing methods.},

Title = {Bus Predictive-Control Method considering the Impact of Traffic Lights},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many travelers have switched from public
   transit to other modes. How to maintain the stability and service
   quality of the bus system under regular pandemic prevention and control,
   so as to maintain the attractiveness of the bus, is an important
   research direction. Predicting operation states and adopting appropriate
   control measures for running buses are effective means of improving the
   bus system's schedule reliability and service quality. Focusing on the
   impacts of intersection traffic lights on the link's travel time
   durations, we establish a probabilistic prediction model for bus
   headways, classifying the bus headways into three states: bunching,
   stable, and big gap states. Based on the prediction of bus headways, the
   most suitable control strategy is selected by the proposed method from
   the plan set, such as holding control, speed-adjusting control, and
   stop-skipping control to minimize the bus headway deviation. Simulation
   experiments were employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
   method. Compared with the no-control situation, the expected headway
   variation, average passenger waiting time, and bus bunching frequency
   for 100 simulations by the proposed method are reduced by 77.73\%,
   41.66\%, and 87.11\%, respectively. Compared with some control methods
   without prediction, the proposed method is more robust, maintains good
   control performance, and reduces bus bunching despite significant
   variations in environmental parameters. In addition, the model still
   performs well when considering the execution errors of bus drivers.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a hierarchical control strategy for a line of
   electric buses with the double objective of minimizing energy
   consumption and providing regular service to the passengers. The
   state-space model for the buses is formulated in space rather than in
   time, which alleviates the need for integer decision variables to
   capture their behavior at bus stops. This enables us to first assemble a
   fully-centralized multi-objective line problem in the continuous
   nonlinear optimization framework. It is then reassembled into a
   hierarchical structure with two levels of control in order to improve on
   scalability and reliability. This new supervisory structure consists of
   a centralized line level controller which handles the time headway
   regularity of the buses, and of decentralized bus level controllers
   which simultaneously manage the energy consumption of each individual
   bus. Our method demonstrates good battery energy savings and regularity
   performances when compared to a classical holding strategy. Copyright

Abstract = {This paper presents a real-time integrated holding and priority control
   strategy for bus rapid transit (BRT) and high-frequency segregated
   transit systems, in a network approach (considering the whole transit
   circuit). The integrated control strategy implements simultaneously the
   required bus headway corrections and the bus priority through signalized
   intersections with the objective of minimizing the total delay of
   passengers that are onboard and at stops. The developed model, in the
   form of a mathematical programming problem, presents peculiarities for
   describing the behavior of BRT and transit systems such as bus capacity,
   differentiation between passenger boarding and alighting processes in
   single stops, terminals and stations, and bus priority at signalized
   intersections. The iterative procedure proposed for solving the
   optimization problem brings about simplicity and efficiency for
   real-time applications. The results obtained by simulation for a transit
   scenario of the trunk line 10 of the city of Blumenau, Santa Catarina,
   Brazil, show the efficiency of the proposed strategy and potential of
   practical application.},

Title = {A Dynamic Holding Approach to Stabilizing a Bus Line Based on the
   Q-Learning Algorithm with Multistage Look-Ahead},

Abstract = {The unreliable service and the unstable operation of a high-frequency
   bus line are shown as bus bunching and the uneven distribution of
   headways along the bus line. Although many control strategies, such as
   the static and dynamic holding strategies, have been proposed to solve
   the above problems, many of them take on some oversimplified assumptions
   about the real bus line operation. So it is hard for them to
   continuously adapt to the evolving complex system. In view of this
   dynamic setting, we present an adaptive holding method that combines the
   classic approximate dynamic programming (ADP) with the multistage
   look-ahead mechanism. The holding time, the only control means used in
   this study, will be determined by estimating its impact on the operation
   stability of the bus line system in the remaining observation period.
   The multistage look-ahead mechanism introduced into the classic
   Q-learning algorithm of the ADP model makes it easy that the algorithm
   gets through its earlier unstable phase more quickly and easily. During
   the implementation of the new holding approach, the past experiences of
   holding operations can be cumulated effectively into an artificial
   neural network used to approximate the unavailable Q-factor. The use of
   a detailed simulation system in the new approach makes it possible to
   take into account most of the possible causes of instability. The
   numerical experiments show that the new holding approach can stabilize
   the system by producing evenly distributed headway and removing bus
   bunching thoroughly. Compared with the terminal station holding
   strategies, the new method brings a more reliable bus line with shorter
   wait},

Abstract = {This paper presents a velocity control/advise algorithm relying on
   vehicle-to-vehicle communication, to ensure the headway homogeneity of
   buses on a joint corridor, i.e. when multiple lines merge and travel on
   the same route. The proposed control method first schedules merging
   buses prior to entering a common line. Second, based on the position and
   velocity of the bus ahead of the controlled one, a shrinking horizon
   model predictive controller (MPC) calculates a proper velocity profile
   for the merging bus. The model is able to predict short time space
   behavior of public transport buses enabling constrained, finite horizon,
   optimal control solution to reach the merging point with equidistant
   headways, taking all buses from different lines into account. The
   controller is tested in a high fidelity traffic simulator with realistic
   scenarios. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic

Title = {Providing real-time bus crowding information for passengers: A novel
   policy to promote high-frequency transit performance},

Abstract = {Bus bunching is of particular concern and undesirable for both operators
   and passengers in highfrequency transit. In contrast to existing control
   methods, this paper proposes a novel control policy, namely, providing
   real-time bus crowding information (BCI) for passengers. It is believed
   that passengers would spontaneously distribute more evenly among buses
   and help to prevent bus bunching with the provision of BCI accompanying
   arrival time information due to the following mechanism. A proportion of
   passengers would be likely to wait a few more minutes for the next bus
   when the current bus is crowded and the next bus is more comfortable,
   and the boarding times of these passengers would make the next bus dwell
   longer and increase its headway from the previous bus. We formulate bus
   motion models incorporating passenger boarding choice under BCI to
   realize the policy in simulation experiments. The results demonstrate
   that the policy can reduce operation instability by approximately 20\%
   in terms of bus headway and single-trip time. In addition, this policy
   can significantly reduce the in-vehicle crowdedness experienced by
   passengers by up to 25\% at the cost of small increases in the mean
   journey time in some cases. The simulation experiments on a
   holding-controlled route also indicate that the proposed policy is able
   to coordinate with holding well. A sensitivity analysis further confirms
   that the policy's performance is robust even if the passengers have low
   inclinations to choose the next bus. The policy of providing BCI in this
   paper is especially effective for bus routes with high passenger demand
   and may have great application potential in practice.},

Title = {Dynamic control of complex transit systems},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a dynamic control method to overcome bunching and
   improve the regularity of fixed-route transit systems. The method uses a
   combination of dynamic holding and en-route driver guidance to achieve
   its objectives. It applies to systems with a mix of headway-based and
   schedule-based lines but it is evaluated for scheduled systems as this
   is the more challenging application. Improved schedule adherence is the
   goal.
   The method's calculation complexity per piece of advice does not
   increase with system size. As a result, the method is scalable and can
   be used with large multi-line systems, no matter how complex. When
   controlled, each vehicle is mostly affected by exogenous disturbances
   (e.g. traffic) and very little by other vehicles. As a result,
   disruptions to a vehicle or group of vehicles caused by inattentive
   drivers or control equipment failures remain confined to the vehicles
   experiencing the problems. The control method effectively quarantines
   ``disease{''}.
   The method is evaluated analytically and with simulations over a broad
   range of conditions, including schedules with zero slack. The method was
   also evaluated by observing the performance of a real world multi-line
   system that uses inexpensive on-board tablets to apply the control. The
   evaluation addresses driver compliance and equipment malfunction issues.
   It is found that the method is resilient and improves reliability
   considerably even under challenging conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Mixed Scheduling Strategy for High Frequency Bus Routes With Common
   Stops},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {34442-34454},
Abstract = {Bus routes overlapping would lead to more than one bus entering the stop
   simultaneously, which may trigger bus bunching. Focusing on high
   frequency routes with common stops, this paper proposes a mixed
   scheduling method combining the all-stop service and the stop-skipping
   service. The method optimizes scheduling strategies for multiple routes
   by minimizing total passenger travel time. The optimization variables
   are binary variables reflecting whether the stops in the overlapping
   area are skipped. Three exciting bus routes are employed for case study.
   Results show that the proposed method reduces total passenger travel
   time by 21.4 \% compared with the current scheduling strategy.},

Abstract = {The degradation of bus system attractiveness is primarily caused by
   low-level service quality and reliability. As an essential technology
   for bus operation management, online bus speed control has proven to be
   a flexible and effective solution to mitigate bus bunching and enhance
   the service level of bus operation systems. In this study, we propose a
   robust nonlinear decision mapping (RNDM) approach that uses real-time
   key bus system states to control bus speeds and accounts for
   uncertainties associated with passenger demands at stations and traffic
   speeds of interstation links. We develop this approach through a design
   process that involves learning the input-output mapping relation of a
   nonlinear programming simulation-based optimization (NLPSO) method using
   regression tree with AdaBoost. Critical parameters of the fitted
   regression tree with AdaBoost are then optimized offline using a
   distributionally robust simulation-based optimization (DRSO) model that
   is solved by a simulation-based optimization (SO) algorithm. The
   resulting RNDM method effectively handles two types of uncertainties,
   expressed by two ambiguity sets of probability distributions, and
   ensures good bus operation performance even under worst-case uncertainty
   levels. Numerical experiments reveal that the RNDM, NLPSO, and integer
   programming SO (IPSO) methods successfully mitigate bus bunching and
   improve service efficiency and robustness, compared to the no-control
   scenario. Furthermore, the RNDM method outperforms NLPSO and IPSO in
   terms of comprehensive performance under uncertainties and demonstrates
   practical operability. In conclusion, this study presents an innovative
   general framework that uses a nonlinear decision mapping optimized
   offline by an SO approach to address online simulation-based optimal
   decision-making problems under uncertainties, which can be applied to
   solve similar problems.},

Title = {Dynamic bus holding strategies for schedule reliability: Optimal linear

Abstract = {As is well known, bus systems are naturally unstable. Without control,
   buses on a single line tend to bunch, reducing their punctuality in
   meeting a schedule. Although conventional schedule-based strategies that
   hold buses at control points can alleviate this problem these methods
   require too much slack, which slows buses. This delays on-board
   passengers and increases operating costs.
   It is shown that dynamic holding strategies based on headways alone
   cannot help buses adhere to a schedule. Therefore, a family of dynamic
   holding strategies that use bus arrival deviations from a virtual
   schedule at the control points is proposed. The virtual schedule is
   introduced whether the system is run with a published schedule or not.
   It is shown that with this approach, buses can both closely adhere to a
   published schedule and maintain regular headways without too much slack.
   A one-parameter version of the method can be optimized in closed form.
   This simple method is shown to be near-optimal. To put it in practice,
   the only data needed in real time are the arrival times of the current
   bus and the preceding bus at the control point relative to the virtual
   schedule. The simple method was found to require about 40\% less slack
   than the conventional schedule-based method. When used only to regulate
   headways it outperforms headway-based methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This study reports bus passengers' behavior and perceptions related to
   the use of potential features of an automatic vehicle location (AVL)
   system in bus transit through conducting an attitudinal on-board survey
   in Bangkok. A passenger waiting-time survey conducted as part of this
   study revealed that passengers perceive waiting-time at bus stops to be
   greater than actually experienced. The other aim of this study is to
   examine the potential benefits of bus-holding using an AVL technology,
   in terms of waiting-time, through minimizing bus bunching under
   different congestion levels. The results are obtained using PARAMICS,
   and reveal a significant reduction in average waiting-time.},

Title = {A self-organizing policy for vehicle dispatching in public transit
   systems with multiple lines},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {46-64},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this paper, we propose and analyze an online, decentralized policy
   for dispatching vehicles in a multi-line public transit system. In the
   policy, vehicles arriving at a terminal station are assigned to the
   lines starting at the station in a round-robin fashion. Departure times
   are selected to minimize deviations from a certain target headway. We
   prove that this policy is self-organizing: given that there is a
   sufficient number of available vehicles, a timetable spontaneously
   emerges that meets the target headway of every line. Moreover, in case
   one of the vehicles breaks down, the remaining vehicles automatically
   redistribute over the network to re-establish such a timetable. We
   present both theoretical and numerical results on the time until a
   stable state is reached and on how quickly the system recovers after the
   breakdown of a vehicle. Experiments on three real-world transit systems
   show that our policy performs well, even if not all assumptions required
   for the theoretical analysis are met: if there are enough vehicles, the
   realized headways are typically close to the target headways. These
   promising results suggest that our self-organizing policy could be
   useful in situations where centralized dispatching is impractical or
   simply impossible due to an abundance of disruptions or the absence of
   information systems.},

Abstract = {With the widespread installation of location-enabled devices on public
   transportation, public vehicles are generating massive amounts of
   trajectory data in real time. However, using these trajectory data for
   meaningful analysis requires careful considerations in storing,
   managing, processing, and visualizing the data. Using the location data
   of the Los Angeles Metro bus system, along with publicly available bus
   schedule data, we conduct a data processing and analyses study to
   measure the performance of the public transportation system in Los
   Angeles utilizing a number of metrics including travel-time reliability,
   on-time performance, bus bunching, and travel-time estimation. We
   demonstrate the visualization of the data analysis results through an
   interactive web-based application. The developed algorithms and system
   provide powerful tools to detect issues and improve the efficiency of
   public transportation systems.},

Abstract = {In February 2014, Singapore embarked on a 2-year trial of a Bus Service
   Reliability Framework (BSRF) to improve en-route bus regularity and
   reduce instances of bus bunching and prolonged waiting times. Based on
   London's Quality Incentive Contract, the Singapore model also imposes
   penalties or provides incentives to operators for increases/reductions
   of Excess Wait Time (EWT) beyond a certain route specific baseline.
   Drawing on insights derived from research on performance-based
   contracts, this paper describes some key considerations surrounding this
   particular innovation in Singapore's overall bus regulatory framework.
   We also discuss an important advancement in our understanding Of how bus
   users value reliability improvements through estimates obtained from
   stated preference data. At the same time, early indications from the
   trial have been encouraging. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Aiming at decreasing average passenger waiting time at stops, headway
   adherence was used to measure the route-level transit service
   reliability for high frequency bus route services. Considering the
   fluctuation of passenger demand and the stochastic nature of running
   time on road segments, a bus-following model was built to prevent
   service unreliability on a circular route of high frequency bus services
   with recurrent buses. In the case study, the Monte-Carlo method was used
   to simulate the process of bus services. Headway variation and average
   passenger wait time at stops were statistically calculated for two
   different situations with no preventive control or preventive control.
   The results showed that, by pre-warning potential big headway deviation
   and triggering real-time preventive control strategies, bus bunching or
   big gap could be avoided and average passenger wait time at stops could
   be reduced.},

Abstract = {Service reliability is a key determinant of public transport
   performance. In the context of high-frequency urban lines, irregular
   service results with long waiting times, bunched vehicles, long delays,
   uneven passenger loads, poor capacity utilization and higher operational
   costs. Field experiments were conducted in Stockholm, Sweden, in order
   to test the feasibility and implications of a regularity-driven
   operation scheme designed to mitigate bus bunching and facilitated by a
   real-time control strategy. This paper investigates alternative service
   indicators and business models that could best support the long-term
   implementation of operation geared towards better regularity
   performance. A paradigm shift towards regularity-based service evidently
   requires the consideration of a series of measures along the service
   chain as it involves a paradigm shift in production planning,
   operations, control center and performance monitoring. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Multiobjective Optimal Formulations for Bus Fleet Size of Public Transit
   under Headway-Based Holding Control},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION},
Year = {2019},
Abstract = {In recent years, with the development of advanced technologies for data
   collection, real-time bus control strategies have been implemented to
   improve the daily operation of transit systems, especially headway-based
   holding control which is a proven strategy to reduce bus bunching and
   improve service reliability for high-frequency bus routes, with the
   concept of regulating headways between successive buses. This hot topic
   has inspired the reconsideration of the traditional issue of fleet size
   optimization and the integrated bus holding control strategy. The
   traditional headway-based control method only focused on the regulation
   of bus headways, without considering the number of buses on the route.
   The number of buses is usually assumed as a given in advance and the
   task of the control method is to regulate the headways between
   successive buses. They did not consider the bus fleet size problem
   integrated with headway-based holding control method. Therefore, this
   work has presented a set of optimal control formulations to minimize the
   costs for the passengers and the bus company through calculating the
   optimal number of buses and the dynamic holding time, taking into
   account the randomness of passenger arrivals. A set of equations were
   formulated to obtain the operation of the buses with headway-based
   holding control or the schedule-based control method. The objective was
   to minimize the total cost for the passengers and the bus company in the
   system, and a Monte Carlo simulation based solution method was
   subsequently designed to solve the optimization model. The effects of
   this optimization method were tested under different operational
   settings. A comparison of the total costs was conducted between the
   headway-based holding control and the schedule-based holding control. It
   was found that the model was capable of reducing the costs of the bus
   company and passengers through utilizing headway-based bus holding
   control combined with optimization of the bus fleet size. The proposed
   optimization model could minimize the number of buses on the route for a
   guaranteed service level, alleviating the problem of redundant bus fleet
   sizes caused by bus bunching in the traditional schedule-based control
   method.},

Abstract = {The problem of operating exclusive bus corridors that have segments with
   bidirectional lanes is treated. On these lanes, only one direction of
   movement is allowed when a bus is present. Such construct requires less
   road space, which is a scarce resource in dense urban areas, and thus
   may be the only feasible alternative for the installation of exclusive
   bus corridors. The system model includes limits on bus passenger
   capacity. The control method for real-time operation integrates bus
   headway corrections and bus priority through signalized intersections,
   while enforcing mutual exclusion of opposing buses on the bidirectional
   lanes. Effectively, the control avoids bus bunching over the entire
   corridor and coordinates the passage of opposing buses on bidirectional
   lanes. The objective is to minimize the total waiting time of
   passengers, both onboard and at stops. Simulation results indicate the
   applicability of the integrated holding and priority bidirectional lane
   control method.},

Abstract = {Bus holding is the most used control strategy to improve bus service
   reliability. This paper presents a coordinated holding control framework
   based on multi-agent reinforcement-learning (MARL-H) to mitigate bus
   bunching in real-time on a bus corridor. The MARL-H framework depicts a
   combination of agents and methods to make decision of coordinated
   holdings. Coordination Graphs (CGs) are introduced in automatically
   selecting the coordinated holding actions in case of multiple buses
   dwelling at stops. Sparse Cooperative Q-learning algorithms are
   developed to obtain the joint coordinated holding actions due to the
   particularity of the sparsely structured graphs. The performance of the
   proposed method is evaluated by simulations. The results show the
   advantages of the MARL-H framework for the coordinated holding control
   in real-time. The proposed method could be embedded in an advanced
   public transportation system to improve bus operation performance.},

Abstract = {To prevent bus bunching, a dynamic headway control method in the V2I
   (vehicle to infrastructure) environment for a high-frequency route with
   bus lane is developed. Bus operating speed guidance on the mid-blocks
   and intersection signal adjustment are two main strategies in the
   proposed method. A forecasting model of bus travel time under the
   dynamic control method is developed. The objective function is set up by
   taking into account differences between actual bus headways and
   dispatching headways, and the scaling ratios of intersection cycle
   lengths. The optimization model is solved using genetic algorithm. The
   proposed method is applied to a real bus route in Meihekou city, China,
   and compared with the current control plan as well as holding strategy.
   Results show that the proposed method can reduce bus headway deviations
   in all investigating periods; negative impacts on cars can be limited by
   setting reasonable values for the parameters.},

Abstract = {The efficiency of Public Transport (PT) has significantly improved
   thanks to Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems. They are used by
   several applications, such as real-ime passenger information systems,
   transit signal priority, and control schemes designed to reduce the
   negative effects of bus bunching. Currently, these applications rely on
   a centralised architecture, i.e. buses equipped with communication and
   location detection technologies constantly send their positions to the
   AVL centre. In this paper, we demonstrate how a distributed AVL system
   can be designed on the basis of Connected Vehicle (CV) technology, i.e.
   information about bus location is exchanged in the PT network via buses
   equipped with the technology. Using computation experiments based on
   microscopic traffic simulations we demonstrate that CV-based AVL works
   efficiently when it comes to providing a bus with information about
   locations of buses ahead of it. However, information about buses behind
   is far less reliable, and requires additional support in message
   dissemination (e.g. by private vehicles).},

Abstract = {Bus travel times are prone to high variability, especially in countries
   that lack lane discipline and have heterogeneous vehicle profiles. This
   leads to negative impacts such as bus bunching, increase in passenger
   waiting time and cost of operation. One way to minimize these issues is
   to accurately predict bus travel times. To address this, the present
   study used a model-based approach by incorporating mean and variance in
   the formulation of the model. However, the accuracy of prediction did
   not improve significantly and hence a machine learning-based approach
   was considered. Support vector machines were used and prediction was
   done using. v-support vector regression with linear kernel function. The
   proposed scheme was implemented in Chennai using data collected from
   public transport buses fitted with global positioning system. The
   performance of the proposed method was analysed along the route, across
   subsections and at bus stops. Results show a clear improvement in
   performance under high variance conditions.},

Title = {An Improved Model for Headway-Based Bus Service Unreliability Prevention
   with Vehicle Load Capacity Constraint at Bus Stops},
Journal = {DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2012},
Abstract = {This paper presents an improved model for improving headway-based bus
   route service reliability at bus stops using real-time preventive
   operation control, taking into account dynamic interaction among random
   passenger demand, stochastic driving conditions of route segments, and
   vehicle load capacity constraint. In this model, the real-time
   information of passenger demand and vehicle operation is involved to
   predict the imminent unacceptable headway deviation, in the case of
   which some in-time preventive control strategies are deployed according
   to the given control rules. As a case study, a single fixed bus route
   with high-frequency services was simulated and different scenarios of
   real-time preventive operation control were performed. Headway adherence
   and average passenger wait time were used to measure bus service
   reliability. The results show that the improved model is closer to the
   real bus route service, and using real-time information to predict
   potential service unreliability and trigger in-time preventive control
   can reduce bus bunching and avoid big gap.},

Abstract = {One of the greatest problems facing transit agencies that operate
   high-frequency routes is maintaining stable headways and avoiding bus
   bunching. In this work, a real-time holding mechanism is proposed to
   dispatch buses on a loop-shaped route using real-time information. Holds
   are applied at one or several control points to minimize passenger
   waiting time while maintaining the highest possible frequency, i.e.
   using no buffer time. The bus dispatching problem is formulated as a
   stochastic decision process. The optimality equations are derived and
   the optimal holding policy is found by backward induction. A control
   method that requires much less information and that closely approximates
   the optimal dispatching policy is found. A simulation assuming
   stochastic operating conditions and unstable headway dynamics is
   performed to assess the expected average waiting time of passengers at
   stations. The proposed control strategy is found to provide lower
   passenger waiting time and better resiliency than methods used in
   practice and recommended in the literature. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {To predict bus arrival time at each stop with complex real-time traffic
   factors changing on the road, this paper proposes a dynamic arrival time
   prediction model for buses, using a combination of real-time taxi and
   bus datasets, with a kernel algorithm of statistical methods or neural
   networks to model the properties of dynamic road circumstances. This is
   a ``rolling{''} prediction method, which uses the prediction result of
   previous step as the input features of the next prediction, to predict
   all bus arrival times of future stops. The result shows that the
   proposed dynamic model is applicable for bus arrival time prediction,
   where datasets with taxi are more accurate than without it. The possible
   bus bunching can be captured by checking the predicted time headway
   between buses from the same bus line, and long-time delay in terminals
   can also be predicted and eliminated by rescheduling departure time of
   targeted buses.},

Abstract = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAV) initiatives are revolutionizing
   the entire transportation society. Not limited in the area of passenger
   cars, public transit agencies also seek for the possibility of replacing
   tremendous manpower with the state-of-the-art ``self-driving{''}
   technologies. In this study, we developed an optimization model to
   quantify how the CAV benefits the route-level transit operations if all
   current non-automated buses are converted into autonomous buses. A
   bi-objective mixed integer programming model is established to minimize
   passenger waiting times and maximize passenger flows considering all
   buses are running on a bus dedicated lane. By taking one actual bus
   route in Beijing as a case study, we computed the operational
   performance indicators of non-automated bus based on smart card and GPS
   data, and compared with the optimized bus routes with CAV technologies.
   The findings reveal that autonomous buses can significantly reduce
   vehicle usages, reduce bus bunching, increase passenger loads, and lower
   average passenger waiting time.},

Abstract = {The potential of low-frequency bus localization data for the monitoring
   and control of bus system performance is investigated in this paper. It
   is shown that data with a sampling rate as low as 1 min, when processed
   appropriately, can provide ample information. Accurate estimates of stop
   arrival and departure times are obtained; these estimates in turn allow
   the analysis of headways and travel times. A three-parameter gamma
   family of distributions is fitted for headways at the stops along a bus
   line. The evolution of the parameters demonstrates critical points on
   the line where bus bunching is significantly increased. Moreover, this
   analysis allows differentiating problems associated with varying
   passenger demand from uncertainties associated with traffic conditions.
   Furthermore it is shown that expected travel time and travel time
   variability can be calculated from low-frequency localization data.
   Finally, the way in which the results can be used to calibrate a
   simulation model that can test bus control strategies is presented. The
   methods are applied and validated to data obtained from Bus Route Number
   1 in Boston, Massachusetts.},

Abstract = {High quality bus service is considered as an efficient way to mitigate
   traffic congestion in big cities. Global positioning system (GPS) data
   provide sufficient sources to evaluate the performance of bus vehicles
   that both passengers and operator concern about. This paper aims to
   propose a framework to assess the operational performance of bus routes
   based on the GPS trajectory data collected from Jinan, China. Several
   important indicators of bus operation including travel time of routes,
   section running time, dwell time and bus bunching have been studied. The
   results show that the travel time of routes follow right skewed
   distributions. Moreover, section running time between two consecutive
   stations varies in different time period and it is larger in evening
   peak hours. Additionally, the dwell time has been discussed and the
   results show that there is no big variation in most stations except some
   stations, which provides a help to identify the key stations.
   Furthermore, we propose an approach to detect the bunching points. The
   results indicate the bunching points are easy to occur in the peak hours
   and the congested road section.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2010},

Pages = {9-18},
Abstract = {Analysis of public transport system performance and level of service in
   urban areas is essential. Dynamic modeling of traffic conditions,
   passenger demand, and transit operations is important to represent
   adequately the complexity of and the interactions between these
   components in modern public transportation systems. This paper presents
   a transit simulation model designed to support evaluation of operations
   planning and control, especially in the context of advanced public
   transportation systems. Unlike most previous efforts in this area, the
   simulation model is built on a platform of a mesoscopic traffic
   simulation model, which allows modeling or the operation dynamics of
   large-scale transit systems, taking into account the main sources of
   service uncertainty and stochasticity. The capabilities of Mezzo as an
   evaluation tool of transit operations are demonstrated with an
   application to a real-world, high-demand bus line in metropolitan Tel
   Aviv, Israel, under various scenarios. The application shows that
   important phenomena such as bus bunching are reproduced realistically. A
   comparison of simulated running times and headway distributions with
   field data shows the model is capable of replicating observed data.},

Abstract = {Real-time headway-based control is a key issue to reduce bus bunching in
   high frequency urban bus services where schedules are difficult to
   implement. Several mechanisms have been proposed in the literature, but
   very few performance comparisons are available. In this paper two
   different approaches are tested over eight different scenarios. Both
   methodologies solve the same problem, the former based on a
   deterministic optimization over a long-term rolling horizon, while the
   latter proposes a hybrid predictive approach considering a shorter
   horizon and a stochastic evolution of the system. The comparison is
   conducted through scenarios that include three different dimensions: (i)
   bus capacities which can be reached or not, (ii) service frequencies,
   considering high and medium frequency services and (iii) different load
   profiles along the corridor. The results show that the deterministic
   approach performs better under scenarios where bus capacity could be
   reached frequently along the route while the hybrid predictive control
   approach performs better in situations where this does not happen. (C)

Abstract = {Travel time reliability plays a key role in bus scheduling and service
   quality. Owing to various stochastic factors, buses often suffer from
   traffic congestion, delay and bunching, which leads to disturbances of
   travel time. Automatic vehicle location (AVL) could record the
   spatiotemporal information of buses, making it possible to understand
   the status of bus service. In this paper, we specifically analyze the
   statistical characteristics of travel time based on historic AVL data.
   Moreover, a Kalman filter-LSTM deep learning is proposed to estimate bus
   travel time. Numerical tests indicate that the travel time of bus routes
   shows a left-skewed and right-tail pattern with a good fit of the
   lognormal distribution. The bus service reliability fluctuates largely
   in the peak hours, especially the morning peak. Bus bunching and large
   bus time headway easily occur, and once it occurs, it will continue
   until destination. The Kalman filter-LSTM model outperforms the ensemble
   learning methods to predict travel time. This study could provide
   implications for transit schedule optimization to improve the bus
   service quality.},

Abstract = {The timetabling subproblem of bus transit network planning determines
   the departure times for all trips of the lines along the entire day.
   Most of the public transport networks consider planning periods
   identical for all lines. In this study we drop this strong assumption by
   introducing specific periods for each line, which is more realistic.
   Thus, we propose the multiperiod synchronization bus timetabling (MSBT)
   problem, which specifies the departure times of the trips of all lines
   where each line has its own planning periods along the day, with the
   objective of optimizing synchronization events: maximize passenger
   transfers and minimize bus bunching along the network.
   We propose an integer linear programming formulation for the MSBT
   problem and analyze the structural properties of this formulation by a
   constraint propagation methodology. These properties are the basis for
   different operators that lead to the design of efficient metaheuristics
   for solving the problem. We empirically obtain high-quality feasible
   solutions for real size instances and show that by considering a
   multiperiod approach, synchronization events of trips belonging to
   different planning periods are not ignored, as it is the case when
   several single period timetables are merged.},

Abstract = {Real-time control strategies are important methods for high-frequency
   transit to counteract the effects of bus bunching in passenger waiting
   time. This paper extends previous literature with the development of an
   optimization model for multiple lines in a corridor capable of executing
   a dynamic control strategy based on passenger choice behavior with
   real-time information. The bi-level model integrates ``passenger
   perceptions,{''}{''}service selection,{''} and ``control strategy{''}
   effectively. The upper level model is a control model with the objective
   of minimizing the total waiting time of passengers in the system
   composed of common lines to decide whether a bus arriving at the hub
   should be held and its holding time. The lower level model is an
   allocation model with the utilization of a Nested Logit model to study
   passenger choice behavior. In addition, a heuristic algorithm is
   introduced to solve the problem. The effectiveness of the model is
   evaluated with the data of two lines in Dalian city of China. The
   results show that the control strategy proposed in this paper
   outperforms the simple control strategy without passenger choice
   behavior, where the waiting time of passengers, the number of buses that
   need to hold, and bus holding time are all reduced.},

Abstract = {In frequently serviced bus routes passengers are more concerned about
   bus headway regularity than actual punctuality of bus arrival to the
   schedule. Buses arriving within very small (bus bunching) or very large
   headways are of particular concern and much less desirable. In this
   study, a time-point (stop) level probability-based headway regularity
   metric to measure bus service reliability is first formulated as a
   function of bus dwell time, number of stops into the trip, passenger
   activities (i.e. arrival, boarding and alighting) and expectation (or
   tolerance) of bus headways. The proposed metric is then applied to
   evaluate a Chicago Transit Authority bus route by using automatic
   vehicle location (AVL) data. It is found that headway regularity during
   a bus trip is closely impacted by dispatching headway. Furthermore, the
   time-point level service reliability declines as passenger activity
   levels increase or as the maximum passenger anticipated headway
   decreases (i.e. passengers become more demanding of frequent bus
   services). The case study demonstrates that the proposed
   probability-based headway regularity measure provides an operationable
   metric to transit agencies in terms of improving the transit service to
   meet passengers' expectation and thus increase ridership. Lastly, this
   study demonstrates another important application of the AVL/APC data.},

Title = {Integrating Bus Holding Control Strategies and Schedule Recovery:
   Simulation-Based Comparison and Recommendation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION},
Year = {2018},
Abstract = {In the absence of control strategies, headway fluctuation and bus
   bunching are commonly observed in transit operation due to the
   stochastic attributes such as travel time and passenger demand. Existing
   research on real-time control largely focused on developing operational
   tactics to maintain bus arrival regularity at stops without fully
   considering the effect of schedule recovery. This paper investigates the
   effect of bus driver behavior on bus holding control strategies and more
   specifically their effort in catching up with schedule in case of delay,
   i.e., schedule recovery. To this end, this paper first proposes a bus
   propagation model with capacity constraint to simulate the evolution of
   bus trajectories along a fixed route. It proceeds to explicitly
   incorporate both holding control actions and schedule recovery effect
   into the bus propagation model. Using simulation for a high-frequency
   bus line in Guangzhou, China, schedule-(SH) and headway-based holding
   (HH) control strategies are compared under various operational settings
   in the context of schedule recovery. These comparisons show that SH
   performs better under certain conditions, and SH generally benefits more
   from schedule recovery than HH. These results provide insights into the
   bus stop layout design and implementation of holding methods in the
   context of cruising guidance.},

   Segregated Transit Services},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2015},
Number = {2533},
Pages = {28-38},
Abstract = {Bus bunching affects transit operations by increasing passenger waiting
   time and variability. To tackle this phenomenon, a wide range of control
   strategies has been proposed. However, none of them have considered
   station and interstation control together. In this study station and
   interstation control were tackled to determine the optimal vehicle
   control strategy for various stops and traffic lights in a single
   service transit corridor. The strategy minimized the total time that
   users must devote to making a trip, taking into account delays for
   transit and general traffic users. Based on a high-frequency,
   capacity-constrained, and unscheduled service (no timetable) for which
   real-time information about bus position (GPS) and bus load (automated
   passenger counter) is available, this study focused on strategies for
   traffic signal priority in the form of green extension considered
   together with holding buses at stops and limiting passenger boarding at
   stops. The decisions on transit signal priority were made according to a
   rolling horizon scheme in which effects over the whole corridor were
   considered in every single decision. The proposed strategy was evaluated
   in a simulated environment under different operational conditions.
   Results showed that the proposed control strategy achieves reductions in
   the excess delay for transit users close to 61.4\% compared with no
   control, while general traffic increases only by 1.5\%.},

Abstract = {Bus headway regularity heavily affects transit riders' attitude for
   choosing public transportation and also serves as an important indicator
   for transit performance evaluation. Therefore, an accurate estimate of
   bus headway can benefit both transit riders and transit operators. This
   paper proposed a relevance vector machine (RVM) algorithm to predict bus
   headway by incorporating the time series of bus headways, travel time,
   and passenger demand at previous stops. Different from traditional
   computational intelligence approaches, RVMcan output the probabilistic
   prediction result, in which the upper and lower bounds of a predicted
   headway within a certain probability are yielded. An empirical
   experiment with two bus routes in Beijing, China, is utilized to confirm
   the high precision and strong robustness of the proposed model. Five
   algorithms {[}support vector machine (SVM), genetic algorithm SVM,
   Kalman filter, k-nearest neighbor, and artificial neural network] are
   used for comparison with the RVM model and the result indicates that RVM
   outperforms these algorithms in terms of accuracy and confidence
   intervals. When the confidence level is set to 95\%, more than 95\% of
   actual bus headways fall within the prediction bands. With the
   probabilistic bus headway prediction information, transit riders can
   better schedule their trips to avoid late and early arrivals at bus
   stops, while transit operators can adopt the targeted correction actions
   to maintain regular headway for bus bunching prevention.},

Title = {Sequential Framework for Short-Term Passenger Flow Prediction at Bus
   Stop},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2014},
Number = {2417},
Pages = {58-66},
Abstract = {Short-term prediction of passenger flow plays an important role in
   real-time bus dispatching. Such prediction is also useful in diagnosing
   bus operation problems, such as forecasting bus bunching. A novel
   framework is proposed in this paper to predict the passenger flow at bus
   stops. The framework consists of three sequential stages. In the first
   stage, a seasonal ARIMA-based method is used to predict the arrival
   passenger count and empty space on a bus when the bus reaches a bus
   stop. The historical passenger arrivals at the bus stop can be obtained
   from the corresponding boarding count data by an allocation approach. In
   the second stage, an event-based method is developed to predict the
   departure passenger counts from the stop. The proposed method
   iteratively forecasts the bus arrival events and consequently updates
   the passenger flow. In the third stage, a Kalman filter based method is
   proposed to predict the waiting passenger counts at the stop according
   to results from the first and second stages. The real-time observed
   waiting passenger count is used as the feedback of the filter to
   minimize the prediction error. Computational results based on the real
   bus line data for passenger flow prediction and its application in
   forecasting bunching confirm that the proposed framework and solution
   algorithm are effective in providing accurate and reliable passenger
   flow prediction.},

Journal = {PUBLIC TRANSPORT},

Abstract = {In high frequency bus service lines buses often come irregularly at the
   stops, often in bunches, due to the uncertainty of the passenger demand
   and behavior and unexpected conditions on the roads. Vehicle holding is
   a commonly used strategy among a variety of control strategies in
   transit operation in order to reduce bus bunching and regulate bus
   headways. This paper investigates a control strategy of holding a group
   of buses at a single or multiple control point(s). By incorporating any
   passenger boarding activities during holding, a single control point
   problem is developed and extended to multiple control points to reduce
   the variance of headways for the downstream stops. The problem is a
   non-convex optimization problem with linear constraints that minimizes
   the total passenger waiting time both on-board and at stops. A heuristic
   is then developed that is easy and fast to implement, which makes it
   suitable for real-time implementation. The model is evaluated with a
   simulation case study by using the real-time bus operation data (i.e.,
   Automatic Vehicle Location and Automatic Passenger Count Data) from the
   Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). The simulation results show that
   considering the boarding activities in the total waiting time, our model
   mitigates the error propagation and maintains steady performance,
   compared to the common models in the literature, which do not consider
   boarding while holding.},

Title = {Comparison of Two Algorithms for Multiline Bus Dynamic Dispatching},
Journal = {DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Dynamic bus scheduling refers to adjusting the departure time according
   to the latest time-varying information or adjusting bus speed in the
   process of operation. These control strategies can prevent bus bunching
   and alleviate traffic pressure. The paper studies the multiline bus
   dynamic scheduling with consideration of departure time and speed
   meanwhile. The hyperheuristic algorithm is proposed, and low-level
   heuristics (LLH) operators are designed. The simulation experiment is
   performed for the passenger flow distribution of different strengths and
   types of different scenarios. By comparing the experimental results of
   genetic algorithm (GA) and hyperheuristic algorithm in solving different
   scenarios, the results show that in smooth, increasing, decreasing, and
   multiconvex passenger flow mode, the performance of the hyperheuristic
   algorithm is higher than that of GA. The promotion rate reaches 18
   similar to 28\%, and especially the average value of the hyperheuristic
   algorithm designed under multiconvex passenger flow is up to 28.62\%,
   significantly reducing passengers' waiting time. By comparing the
   stability of the three passenger flow modes, the results illustrate that
   the stability of the hyperheuristic algorithm is lower than that of GA.
   For the smooth passenger flow mode, the stability of medium and lower
   density of GA is higher than that of the hyperheuristic algorithm. In
   comparison, the high-density stability of the hyperheuristic algorithm
   is better than that of GA.},

Abstract = {Providing regularity in buses' operation in high-frequency services is
   essential to offer a good quality of service to users. If buses are not
   dispatched at regular headways from the terminal, headway irregularity
   will gradually increase along the line. In this work, we study a vehicle
   dispatching problem in which multiple lines start their operations from
   a common terminal where buses can interchange between lines. The model
   simultaneously decides the ideal dispatching headway for each line and
   assigns the following arriving buses to the terminal its line to operate
   and its corresponding dispatching time. The objective is to minimize the
   dispatching interval's deviation from an ideal headway that is
   dynamically updated based on the system's status. We formulate our
   problem as a Mixed-integer quadratic problem and adopt a rolling horizon
   policy to cope with the dynamic and stochastic environment of public
   transit systems. We prove that a bus assignment that satisfies the FIFO
   discipline is an optimal solution for the proposed problem. We evaluate
   our model in a simulation environment under different operational
   conditions and study the incremental benefits of allowing different
   flexibility schemes. Our results show that a full flexibility scheme
   where buses can freely interchange between lines reduces the coefficient
   of variation of dispatch headways and improves frequency compliance by
   nearly 20\% when compared with the case where buses are restricted to
   operate in a single line. It also outperforms a myopic heuristic that
   adopts a a priori target headway. Computational times are compatible
   with real-time applications.},

Abstract = {Control strategies that prevent bus bunching allow for improvement to
   the level of service offered by a transit corridor as well as reducing
   travel time and its variability, thus providing higher reliability to
   the user. Several optimization models based on the use of real-time
   information have been shown to achieve this, through the planning of
   holding of the buses at bus stops. In the majority of the cases the
   benefits of these models have been estimated assuming ideal operational
   conditions while only few of them have been tested in real conditions.
   However, neither the simulation experiment, nor the real implementations
   have quantified the effects of real-life phenomena that harm the
   performance of the system, preventing it from achieving the full
   potential of these control schemes.
   This paper examines three phenomena that may occur during the operation
   of a bus service, which would limit the effectiveness of a holding-based
   control strategy in the sense that some of the planned holdings might
   not be executed. These phenomena are drivers non-compliance, failure of
   communication systems with buses, and the combination of both. The
   objective is to estimate the negative impact these phenomena can have on
   the benefits of the strategy, and to identify possible measures that
   could help operators and decision makers to reduce this impact. Both
   objectives are achieved using the real-time holding model developed by
   Delgado et al. (2012), which is tested in a simulation environment. (C)

Abstract = {In the absence of system control strategies, it is common to observe bus
   bunching in transit operations. A transit operator would benefit from an
   accurate forecast of bus operations in order to control the system
   before it becomes too disrupted to be restored to a stable condition. To
   accomplish this, we present a general bus prediction framework. This
   framework relies on a stochastic and event-based bus operation model
   that provides sets of possible bus trajectories based on the observation
   of current bus positions, available via global positioning system (GPS)
   data. The median of the set of possible trajectories, called a particle,
   is used as the prediction. In particular, this enables the anticipation
   of irregularities between buses. Several bus models are proposed
   depending on the dwell and inter-stop running time representations.
   These models are calibrated and applied to a real case study thanks to
   the high quality data provided by TriMet (the Portland, Oregon, USA
   transit district). Predictions are finally evaluated by an a posteriori
   comparison with the real trajectories. The results highlight that only
   bus models accounting for the bus load can provide valid forecasts of a
   bus route over a large prediction horizon, especially for headway
   variations. Accounting for traffic signal timings and actual traffic
   flows does not significantly improves the prediction. Such a framework
   paves the way for further development of refined dynamic control
   strategies for bus operations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Simulation-Based Optimization in a Bidirectional <i>A/B</i> Skip-Stop
   Bus Service},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {15478-15489},
Abstract = {A two-way bus corridor system always suffers severe demand imbalance
   between their two operational directions during the peak hours. This
   paper intends to minimize the average passenger travel time by applying
   the A/B skip-stop strategy in such an imbalance situation. This strategy
   defined three types of stations: A , B , and AB . In the service, the
   buses depart alternately from the original station as type A and B , and
   A (or B ) buses serve A (or B ) stations, as well as AB stations. Then
   the problem becomes determining the skip-stop patterns for both
   directions. A heuristic genetic algorithm is adopted to solve this
   problem with a kernel of a precise simulation model depicting the bus
   system. Finally, we apply the optimization method to a realistic bus
   corridor of BRT line 1 in Beijing, China. Results demonstrate that the
   bidirectional A/B skip-stop service prevails over the unidirectional
   services applying A/B skip-stop only on one direction, and the common
   used regular service visiting all stations. It is certificated that the
   bidirectional skip-stop service reduces bus bunching, yields a more
   balanced bus load and provides a smooth bus service with lower cycle
   time and variability. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to
   show the impacts of some key attributes on potential benefits of
   bidirectional skip-stop service. Finally, the elastic demand case where
   transferring passengers may change their origins or destinations has
   been discussed.},

Title = {Pre-Control Strategies for Downstream Bus Service Reliability With
   Traffic Signal},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {148853-148864},
Abstract = {As an undesired behavior of the transport system, headway fluctuation or
   even bus bunching reduce reliability of bus stop service for waiting
   passengers. This paper proposes a pre-control method to improve the
   balance of service intervals at downstream stop through an adjustment of
   green time for bus passing, in which priority and delay of bus passing
   can be achieved. The proposed pre-control strategies at intersection are
   triggered based on prediction of service intervals at downstream stop to
   select priority or delay strategy that includes adjusting starting and
   ending time of green light. Meanwhile, the influence of adjustment of
   green time on surrounding traffic delay of vehicle is also considered.
   The traffic delay is estimated for vehicles arriving during phases
   within associated two signal cycles induced by the signal adjustment. To
   derive optimal adjustment of green time, a multi-objective function is
   established and the objectives include deviation of the bus service
   intervals and traffic average delay. An exhaustive search algorithm is
   programmed to solve the objective function. The effects of control
   strategies are tested by numerical experiments based upon a real bus
   route in Changchun. Results show that the bus service reliability can be
   improved through a proper signal pre-control and, compared with the
   single control strategy with only bus delay, the standard deviations of
   service intervals with the average running time and the stochastic
   running time are improved by 8.53\% and 7.31\%, respectively.},

Title = {Decentralized signal control for multi-modal traffic network: A deep
   reinforcement learning approach},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2023},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Managing traffic flow at intersections in a large-scale network remains
   challenging. Multi-modal signalized intersections integrate various
   objectives, including minimizing the queue length and maintaining
   constant bus headway. Inefficient traffic signals and bus headway
   control strategies may cause severe traffic jams, high delays for bus
   passengers, and bus bunching that harms bus line operations. To
   simultaneously improve the level of service for car traffic and the bus
   system in a multi-modal network, this paper integrates bus priority and
   holding with traffic signal control via decentralized controllers based
   on Reinforcement Learning (RL). The controller agents act and learn from
   a synthetic traffic environment built with the microscopic traffic
   simulator SUMO. Action information is shared among agents to achieve
   cooperation, forming a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
   framework. The agents simultaneously aim to minimize vehicles' total
   stopping time and homogenize the forward and backward space headways for
   buses approaching intersections at each decision step. The Deep
   Q-Network (DQN) algorithm is applied to manage the continuity of the
   state space. The tradeoff between the bus transit and car traffic
   objectives is discussed using various numerical experiments. The
   introduced method is tested in scenarios with distinct bus lane layouts
   and bus line deployments. The proposed controller outperforms
   model-based adaptive control methods and the centralized RL method
   regarding global traffic efficiency and bus transit stability.
   Furthermore, the remarkable scalability and transferability of trained
   models are demonstrated by applying them to several different test
   networks without retraining.},

Abstract = {Bunching is a well-known operational problem for transit agencies and it
   has negative impacts on service quality and users' perception. While
   there has been a substantial amount of literature about understanding
   the factors associated with bus bunching and strategies used to mitigate
   the effects of this problem, there has been little research on streetcar
   bunching. Although bus and streetcar systems share many similarities,
   one major difference between the two is that streetcars cannot overtake
   each other. This makes bunching in streetcar networks more critical to
   the reliability of the system and an important topic that requires more
   in-depth understanding. This research aims at understanding the factors
   that are associated with the likelihood of streetcar bunching and to
   investigate in greater detail the external and internal factors that
   relate to the time to the initial bunching incident from terminal. To
   achieve the first goal, the study uses a binary logistic regression
   model, while it uses an accelerated failure time model to address the
   second goal. The study utilizes automatic vehicle location system data
   acquired from the Toronto Transit Commission, the transit provider for
   the City of Toronto. The models' results show that headway deviations at
   terminals are related to both an increase in the probability of bunching
   and an acceleration of the time to bunching. The discrepancy in vehicle
   types between two successive streetcars also has the same relationship
   as headway deviations at terminals. This study offers a better
   understanding of the factors that are associated with streetcar service
   bunching, which is an important component of transit service
   reliability.},

Title = {Bus arrival time prediction and reliability analysis: An experimental
   comparison of functional data analysis and Bayesian support vector
   regression},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {111},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {To maintain the stability and punctuality of bus systems, an accurate
   forecast of arrival time is essential to devise control strategies to
   prevent bus bunching especially under congested traffic conditions.
   Transit agencies provide travelers with accurate and reliable bus
   arrival times to downstream stations to improve transit service quality
   so as to attract more transit riders. Varieties of approaches have been
   dedicated to providing high prediction accuracy while the measure of the
   associated uncertainty is ignored. Noting that the quantification of
   uncertainty is vital for robust performance, this paper proposes
   data-driven approaches based on the Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and
   Bayesian Support Vector Regression (BSVR) for short-term bus travel time
   prediction while anticipating various uncertainties. To capture
   spatial-temporal dynamic traffic conditions along the route so as to
   increase the accuracy of the journey time prediction and to capture the
   skewness in journey time distribution, a probabilistic nested delay
   operator is adopted. Journey time reliability analysis is then conducted
   using the skewness of dynamic journey time distribution. An empirical
   study is carried out by fusing the bus transit date of No. 261 bus route
   and Floating Car Data (FCD) in Guangzhou. The proposed FDA and BSVR
   methods applied in conjunction with the probabilistic nested delay
   operator turn out to be highly competitive when performing forecasts
   under various traffic conditions. Comparative studies indicate that FDA
   provides more accurate prediction results and tends to anticipate
   uncertainties in journey time distribution more effectively. (C) 2021

   With a Metamodel Approach},

Abstract = {Arrival time predictions for the next available bus or train are a key
   component of modern traveler information systems (TISs). A great deal of
   research has been conducted within the intelligent transportation system
   community in developing an assortment of different algorithms that seek
   to increase the accuracy of these predictions. However, the inherent
   stochastic and nonlinear nature of these systems, particularly in the
   case of bus transport, means that these predictions suffer from variable
   sources of error, stemming from variations in weather conditions, bus
   bunching, and numerous other sources. In this paper, we tackle the issue
   of uncertainty in bus arrival time predictions using an alternative
   approach. Rather than endeavor to develop a superior method for
   prediction, we take existing predictions from a TIS and treat the
   algorithm generating them as a black box. The presence of
   heteroscedasticity in the predictions is demonstrated and then a
   metamodel approach is deployed, which augments existing predictive
   systems using quantile regression to place bounds on the associated
   error. As a case study, this approach is applied to data from a
   real-world TIS in Boston. This method allows bounds on the predicted
   arrival time to be estimated, which give a measure of the uncertainty
   associated with the individual predictions. This represents to the best
   of our knowledge the first application of methods to handle the
   uncertainty in bus arrival times that explicitly takes into account the
   inherent heteroscedasticity. The metamodel approach is agnostic to the
   process generating the predictions, which ensures the methodology is
   implementable in any system.},

Title = {A Prediction Model for Bus Arrival Time at Bus Stop Considering Signal
   Control and Surrounding Traffic Flow},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {127672-127681},
Abstract = {The arrival time of bus at the stop is critical data in design of bus
   operational strategies. Especially for real-time control strategies
   (i.e., signal priority system), bus arrival time is usually predicted to
   assess the next bus operation condition in the future (i.e., bus
   bunching and reliability of transit service) and then can be used as a
   decision basis of current control actions. The signalized intersection
   and surrounding traffic are the key factors in bus travel time
   prediction, but most previous approaches focus on the impact of signal
   control on bus delay only. This paper proposes a prediction model for
   arrival time at bus stop under the influence of both upstream signalized
   intersection and surrounding traffic flow. Considering the affected
   range of signalized intersection and the dynamic variation of bus speed,
   bus running processes are evaluated separately (including processes from
   a given detection point to stop line, through intersection, and from
   intersection to bus stop). In the proposed models, bus speed is deduced
   according to the change of traffic density at different locations to
   reflect the micro-impact of surrounding traffic flow on bus operation.
   The observed bus travel time is collected from actual investigations at
   two bus stops incorporating signalized intersection in Jinan City and
   compared with the predicted travel time in the proposed model. The
   results show that the proposed model has a low mean relative error. In
   addition, through the analysis of the maximum relative error, it also
   can be seen that vehicle queuing with random arrival of vehicles at stop
   line makes a gap between the prediction and the actual situation, which
   will be the focus of further research.},

Abstract = {Bus bunching is an instability problem where buses operating on high
   frequency public transport lines arrive at stops in bunches. In this
   work, we unveil that bus-following models can be used to design
   bus-to-bus cooperative control strategies and mitigate bunching. The use
   of bus-following models avoids the explicit modelling of bus-stops,
   which would render the resulting problem discrete, with events occurring
   at arbitrary time intervals. In a ``follow-the-leader{''} two-bus
   system, bus-to-bus communication allows the driver of the following bus
   to observe (from a remote distance) the position and speed of a lead bus
   operating in the same transport line. The information transmitted from
   the lead bus is then used to control the speed of the follower to
   eliminate bunching. In this context, we first propose practical linear
   and nonlinear control laws to regulate space headways and speeds, which
   would lead to bunching cure. Then a combined state estimation and remote
   control scheme, which is based on the Linear-Quadratic Gaussian theory,
   is developed to capture the effect of bus stops, traffic disturbances,
   and randomness in passenger arrivals. To investigate the behaviour and
   performance of the developed approaches the 9-km 1-California line in
   San Francisco with about 50 arbitrary spaced bus stops is used.
   Simulations with real passenger data obtained from the San Francisco
   Municipal Transportation Agency are carried out. Results show bunching
   avoidance and significant improvements in terms of schedule reliability
   of bus services and delays. The proposed control is robust, scalable in
   terms of public transport network size, and thus easy to implement in
   real-world settings.},

Abstract = {The time gap between two successive buses is called headway in transport
   systems. In moderate/high frequency routes, with moderate/small
   headways, the random perturbations (traffic conditions, passenger
   arrivals, etc.), can alter the headway along the route significantly
   which possibly leads to bunching of buses. Two or more (successive)
   buses may start travelling together. Bus bunching results in inefficient
   and unreliable bus service and is one of the critical problems faced by
   bus agencies. Thus it is imperative to reduce the bunching possibilities
   (probability). Another important aspect is the expected time that a
   typical passenger has to wait before the arrival of its bus. If one
   increases the headway, the bunching chances might reduce, however, may
   significantly increase the passenger waiting times. We precisely study
   this inherent trade-off and derive a bus schedule optimal for a joint
   cost related to all the trips, which is a weighted combination of the
   two performance measures.
   We consider a system with Markovian travel times, fluid passenger
   arrivals and derive dynamic headways which control the bus frequency
   based on the observed system state. The observation is a delayed
   information of the time gaps between successive bus arrivals at various
   stops, corresponding to two earlier (previous to previous) trips. We
   solve the relevant dynamic programming equations to obtain near-optimal
   policies, and the approximation improves as the load factor reduces. The
   near-optimal policy turns out to be linear in previous headway and the
   (earlier) bus-inter-arrival times. Using Monte Carlo based simulations,
   we demonstrate that the proposed dynamic policies significantly improve
   (both) the performance measures, in comparison with the previously
   proposed partial dynamic policies that only depend upon the headways of
   the previous trips.},

Title = {Simulation-Based Sensitivity Analysis for Evaluating Factors Affecting
   Bus Service Reliability: A Big and Smart Data Implementation},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {201937-201955},
Abstract = {Service quality is a significant concern for both providers and users of
   public transportation. It is crucial for transit agencies to clearly
   recognize the causes of unreliability before adapting any improvement
   strategy. However, evaluation of main causes of bus service
   unreliability has not been investigated well. Existing studies have
   three main limitations in context of recognizing causes of service
   unreliability. First, public transport networks and traffic condition
   are highly complex systems and most of the existing models are not
   capable to accurately determine the relationship between service
   irregularity and impact factors. Second, definition of ``Big data{''}
   has been neglected and most of the studies only focused on one source of
   large scale data set to determine the causes of unreliability. Third,
   bus service unreliability can impact the users' perception toward the
   public transport, significantly. It has been recommended by number of
   studies that bus service reliability should be evaluated from both
   service providers' and users' perspective. However, the impact of
   service unreliability from passengers' perception is not well
   investigated, yet. Consequently, we proposed a novel simulation-based
   sensitivity analysis to evaluating main causes of bus service
   unreliability using a combination of three different sources of big
   data. Moreover, for the first time we developed a simulation model in R
   studio which is an open source and powerful coding environment.
   According to the results, the level of reliability in Route U32 showed
   the highest sensitivity to headway variations. Waiting time can be
   decreased by 61\% if only bus operators can reduce the headway variation
   by 25\% of the actual observed data. Big gap and bus bunching could be
   almost disappeared by decreasing headway variations. Moreover, the
   terminal departure policy could significantly improve the passenger
   waiting time. Waiting time can be decreased by 36\% when almost all the
   buses depart the terminal on-time.},

Abstract = {Buses on the same route tend to bunch when the system is uncontrolled.
   This lack of regularity leads to an increase in the average passenger
   waiting time, increases delays and makes travel times uncertain. A wide
   variety of solutions have been proposed to maintain accurate bus system
   performance. Unfortunately, if a strategy is applied permanently, it
   could detract from the entire transport system efficiency. That is why a
   transit operator needs an accurate forecast of the route in order to
   intervene before the bus route is too disrupted to be restored to
   regularity. This paper aims to predict critical situations in real-time
   forecasting of a bus route state. To accomplish this, we propose to take
   advantage of both theoretical and empirical information (model and data)
   using data assimilation (a particle filter). On one hand, a stochastic
   dynamic bus model forecasts future bus route states. On the other hand,
   archived data calibrates the model parameters while real-time data
   provides information about the actual route state. The methodology is
   applied to a real case study thanks to the quality data provided by
   TriMet (the Portland, Oregon transit district). Predictions are finally
   evaluated by an a posteriori comparison with real data. The results
   highlight that the method leads to a valid forecast of a bus route state
   with a 8 minutes time window. This duration is sufficient to predict
   critical situations, especially bus bunching. Further research would
   have to consider deterministic travel times from a traffic model instead
   of the distributions in order to maintain correlation between travel
   times on links. In that case, the assimilation process would focus on
   the surrounding traffic flow, also potentially available in the Portland
   data. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Using simulation model as a tool for analyzing bus service reliability
   and implementing improvement strategies},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Bus services naturally tend to be unstable and are not always capable of
   adhering to schedules without control strategies. Therefore, bus users
   and bus service providers face travel time variation and irregularity.
   After a comprehensive review of the literature, a significant gap was
   recognized in the field of public transportation reliability. According
   to literature, there is no consistency in reliability definition and
   indicators. Companies have their own definition of bus service
   reliability, and they mostly neglect the passengers' perspective of
   reliability. Therefore, four reliability indicators were selected in
   this study to fill the gap in the literature and cover both passengers'
   and operators' perceptions of reliability: waiting time and on-board
   crowding level from passengers' perspective, and headway regularity
   index at stops (HRIS) and bus bunching/big gap percentage from
   operators' perspective. The primary objective of this research is to
   improve the reliability of high frequency of bus service and simulation
   tools currently being used by the public transportation companies.
   Therefore, a simulation model of bus service was developed to study the
   strategies to alleviate it. Four different types of strategies were
   selected and implemented according to Route U32 (Kuala Lumpur)
   specifications. Model out-put showed that control strategies such as
   headwaybased dispatching could significantly improve headway regularity
   by almost 62\% and the waiting time by 51\% on average. Both holding
   strategies at key stops (previous and Prefol holding) have shown an
   almost similar impact on reliability indicators. Waiting time was
   reduced by 44\% and 43\% after the previous and Prefol Headway
   strategies were adopted, respectively. However, the implementation of
   the component of headway-based strategies at the terminal and key stops
   showed the best impact on reliability, in terms of passenger waiting
   time. Waiting time and excess waiting time were both significantly
   reduced by 52.86\% and 81.44\%, respectively. Nevertheless, the
   strategies did not show any significant positive effect on the level of
   crowding during morning peak hours.},

Title = {Locating fixed roadside units in a bus transport network for maximum

Abstract = {A key issue in solving the difficult bus-bunching problem' is being able
   to have reliable information about the location of the buses in the
   network. Most advanced public transport systems have buses with GPS
   devices, but the problem remains of how to send reliable information
   from the buses to the control unit, particularly when the density of
   buses is low, but there are high communications reliability
   requirements. As a solution, we study locating roadside units (RSUs)
   along the route. The buses, together with the RSUs, form a linear
   vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). The RSUs are deployed so to maximize
   the probability of a vehicle communicating with an RSU in at most two
   hops. Previous studies on RSU location never took into account two hops,
   a conceptually different type of network. Rather, they consider that a
   vehicle is able to communicate only directly to an RSU (one hop), which
   is a well-known Maximum Covering Problem, in which one of the parties is
   always immobile, similar to a mobile phone network. Oppositely, our
   method solves the problem in which two of the intervening parties are
   mobile and communicate with each other, not possible to solve as a
   Maximum Covering Problem. We estimate the probability of a vehicle
   accessing successfully an RSU either directly or through the relay of
   another vehicle. This probability is later embedded in an integer
   programming formulation that optimizes the RSU locations for maximum
   communications likelihood.
   Numerical examples show that the connection probability is strongly
   dependent on the coverage ratio of the transmitters and receivers and
   relatively independent on the vehicle density on the network, when
   densities are low. Results also show that it is possible to find some
   cost-efficient solutions which result in a smaller number of RSUs
   located while assuring a connection probability of 0.9 or higher. (C)
