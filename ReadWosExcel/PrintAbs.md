### 1. Range-Constrained Traffic Assignment with Multi-Modal Recharge for Electric Vehicles
> Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are sustainable alternatives to internal combustion engine vehicles thanks to the use of environmentally-friendly electric energy and the reduction of off-gas emissions. One of the major concerns associated with the adoption of PEVs is the distance limit, i.e. the fact that PEVs may not be able to complete trips without recharging. In this study, we propose to model the assignment of mixed-vehicular traffic of PEVs with two different charging capabilities accounting for PEV range constraints. We consider two recharge modes: charging stations with recharge time and modern charging lanes where PEVs are recharged automatically by traversing the lanes. The main objective of this study is to explore the influences of multi-modal recharge service provision on individual trips and network performance. First, a network transformation method is proposed to incorporate recharge decisions within the PEV route choice model. Second, we develop a novel convex programming formulation for mixed-vehicular traffic assignment accounting for en-route multi-modal recharge, derive mathematical properties and propose solution algorithms. In this rich traffic assignment framework, PEV route choice is represented as a resource-constrained shortest path subproblem with recharge time and we identify a suitable exact algorithm to solve this subproblem during the assignment process. Finally, computational experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed models and algorithms. The numerical results reveal that the incorporation of PEV multi-modal recharge has a significant impact on both route choice strategies and equilibrium flow patterns, wherein influencing factors include the distance limit, deployment of charging stations and charging lanes, and recharge time. In addition, we identify counter-intuitive configurations with regard to the way range constraints and recharge time reshape the equilibrium network flows.
### 2. Multi-Modal Combined Route Choice Modeling in the MaaS Age Considering Generalized Path Overlapping Problem
> In the MaaS (Mobility as a Service) age, the alternatives of route choice for a trip will not be the single mode paths, but the combined routes utilizing more than one travel mode in the multi-modal transportation systems. When modeling the multi-modal combined route choices, alternative routes are correlated not only because of the overlapping of physical links, but also because of the overlapping of travel modes. We define this problem as the generalized path overlapping problem. To address the generalized overlapping problem, a multi-modal logit kernel (MLK) model is proposed to explicitly consider the correlations of unobserved utilities of combined routes. In this model, the unobserved utilities of combined routes are divided to two parts, the link specific parts and the independent route specific parts. The link specific parts are further divided to two parts: physical link specific and the mode specific. The generalized path overlapping problem is captured by the sharing of these two parts of unobserved link utilities. Based on this model, the stochastic user equilibrium on multi-model transport networks is represented as a fixed-point problem. Numerical studies are designed to illustrate the effects of incorporating generalized overlapping problem on disaggregated route choice prediction and aggregated traffic flow assignment. With different settings of physical link and mode specific error terms, the variations of disaggregated route choice predictions and aggregated traffic flows are discussed. It is found that, the generalized overlapping problem can be captured by the proposed model and significantly affect both the individual route choice predictions and aggregated traffic flows at equilibrium.
### 3. A multi-modal transport model for integrated planning
> Transport models are applied to support the planner in the process of planning and decision making. Models attempt to replicate the system of interest and the system's behaviour. The presented model considers the transportation system with its interactions between the several supply systems and the demand system. The transport model, implemented in a software product called VISUM, consists of a network model describing the structure of the supply systems, a demand model simulating activities and generating trip chains, multi-modal assignment models to determine service quality and route choice.
### 4. Stochastic route choice set generation: Behavioral and probabilistic foundations
> This article addresses the generation of choice sets for the purposes of route choice analysis and flow prediction in uni-modal and multi-modal networks. Ample attention is devoted to the implications for choice set generation of these various purposes. Based on a theory on choice behavior, a new model-based choice set generation approach will be elaborated, called the doubly stochastic choice set generation model, meant for establishing choice sets prior to the choice modeling step. Because of its stochastic principle, a typical property of the proposed generation approach is that the size and composition of the generated choice sets are stochastic variables. We will devote ample attention to these stochastic properties using theoretical derivations and experimental studies. The article reports on the calibration of this generation approach for multi-modal networks and illustrates the approach with a number of predictions in various networks.
### 5. Modeling competitive multi-modal transit services: a nested logit approach
> In metropolitan areas where multi-modal trips are common, modeling the combined-mode choices of travelers, and the strategic interactions between the private service operators are important issues. This study developed a novel network approach, designated as state-augmented multi-modal (SAM) network, to explicitly consider transfer behaviors and non-linear fare structures. To overcome the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption associated with the standard logit approach, we integrated the SAM network with the nested logit (NL) approach. Specifically, we developed a three-level NL choice model to deal with the complex and inter-related decisions in a multi-modal network: the first level focuses on combined-mode choice, the second on transfer location choice, and the third on route choice. Using this NL SAM network as a platform, we examined the effect of fare competition on company profitability as well as on overall network congestion. A case study of the ground transportation system connecting the Hong Kong International Airport to the downtown area is provided to illustrate the approach. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

### 6. Modeling transfer and non-linear fare structure in multi-modal network
> In metropolitan areas where multi-modal trips are common, modeling transfers is an important issue. The existing approach of connecting multi-modal networks, without attending to the number or kinds of transfers, cannot fully describe actual behavior. In addition, the common practice of non-linear transit fare structures imposes certain modeling difficulties on the assignment approach. In this study, we develop a formulation to overcome these two difficulties, namely the number and kinds of transfers are explicitly considered and non-linear fare structures accommodated. Through a state augmentation technique, we transform a multi-modal network to one we call state-augmented multi-modal (SAM) network. Once formulated, the SAM network behaves like a simple network and can be combined with traffic assignment or network analysis procedures. A numerical example is provided to illustrate this approach.

### 7. MULTI-LAYER NETWORK APPROACH FOR MODELING GENERAL COMBINED-MODE TRIPS
> This paper describes a multi-layer approach for modeling general combined-mode trips. The model formulation is based on an extended network framework. termed a multi-layer network. Two major problems arising from the specification of a multi-modal network equilibrium model are addressed, i.e. route (or path) enumeration and travel choice in a network with multiple transport modes. It is shown that the multi-layer network approach can facilitate the generation of feasible routes in a multi-modal setting. A feasible route in the multi-layer network is characterized by a combined mode, which indicates the feature of the used modes or mode combinations along the route. All feasible routes between each origin-destination (OD) pair are grouped, according to the combined modes of routes, into four subsets: auto, transit, auto-transit, and pure walking. The travel choice model is given by a nested logit model where the upper level is focused on combined-mode choice while the lower level on route choice. The multi-modal network equilibrium problem is mathematically formulated as a variational inequality (VI) problem. In addition, interactions among various motorized modes sharing the same road space, as well as nonlinear transit fare structures are taken into account in the multi-modal network equilibrium problem.
### 8. A study on network design problems for multi-modal networks by probit-based stochastic user equilibrium
> This paper develops a multi-modal transport network model considering various travel modes including railway, bus, auto, and walking. Travellers are assumed to choose their multi-modal routes so as to minimise their perceived disutilities of travel following the Probit Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE) condition. Factors influencing the disutility of a multi-modal route include actual travel times, discomfort on transit systems, expected waiting times, fares, and constants specific to transport modes. The paper then deals with the multi-modal network design problem (NDP). The paper employs the method of sensitivity analysis to define linear approximation functions between the Probit SUE link flows and the design parameters, which are then used as constraints in the sub-problem of the NDP instead of the original SUE condition. Based on this reformulated NDP, an efficient algorithm for solving the problem is proposed in the paper. Two instances of this general NDP formulation are then presented in the paper: the optimal frequency design problem for public transport services (FDP), and the anti-freezing admixture dispersion problem (AADP).
### 9. A reliability-based traffic assignment model for multi-modal transport network under demand uncertainty
> In densely populated and congested urban areas, the travel times in congested multi-modal transport networks are generally varied and stochastic in practice. These stochastic travel times may be raised from day-to-day demand fluctuations and would affect travelers' route and mode choice behaviors according to their different expectations of on-time arrival. In view of these, this paper presents a reliability-based user equilibrium traffic assignment model for congested multi-modal transport networks under demand uncertainty. The stochastic bus frequency due to the unstable travel time of bus route is explicitly considered. By the proposed model, travelers' route and mode choice behaviors are intensively explored. In addition, a stochastic state-augmented multi-modal transport network is adopted in this paper to effectively model probable transfers and non-linear fare structures. A numerical example is given to illustrate the merits of the proposed model. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
### 10. A multi-modal network equilibrium model with captive mode choice and path size logit route choice
> In this paper, we consider captive mode travelers (those who have no other choices but rely on one specific travel mode for daily commuting trips) in a multi-modal network equilibrium (MMNE) problem. Specifically, the dogit model is adopted to account for captive mode travelers in the modal split problem, and the path-size logit (PSL) model is used to capture route overlapping effects in the traffic assignment problem. The dogit-PSL MMNE model is formulated as an equivalent entropybased mathematical programming (MP) problem, which admits solution existence and uniqueness. Three numerical examples are provided. The first example examines the effects of mode captivity and route overlapping on network performances and observes that accounting for captive mode travelers would produce different equilibrium states and hence the network performance indicators. The second example applies the dogit-PSL MMNE model for evaluating the exclusive bus lane (EBL) expansion plans, in which a consistent synthetic proportional index is proposed. Numerical results show that considering mode captivity may produce substantial impacts on the odds (up to 50 percent of odds in the given scenarios) of making different EBL line expansion decisions. The third example implements the dogit-PSL MMNE model in the Seoul network to show the applicability of the dogitPSL MMNE model in a real-size multi-modal system.
### 11. A simulation tool for bicycle sharing systems in multimodal networks
> This paper presents a methodology for modelling an urban transport system, integrating public bicycles in a multi-modal network. A bike cost function that reproduces the effect of slopes on cycling speeds is proposed. Also, the effect of traffic levels on the attractiveness of cycling routes is taken into account. The model applies the modal split and network assignment phases in a multimodal network with different classes of users. It has been verified over a test network and then validated by applying it to a real case in the city of Santander in Spain. The results obtained make this model a useful decision-making tool to encourage the use of the public bicycle from a sustainable development point of view.
### 12. A SIMULATION-BASED DYNAMIC TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT MODEL WITH COMBINED MODES
> This paper presents a dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model for urban multi-modal transportation network by constructing a mesoscopic simulation model. Several traffic means such as private car, subway, bus and bicycle are considered in the network. The mesoscopic simulator consists of a mesoscopic supply simulator based on MesoTS model and a time-dependent demand simulator. The mode choice is simultaneously considered with the route choice based on the improved C-Logit model. The traffic assignment procedure is implemented by a time-dependent shortest path (TDSP) algorithm in which travellers choose their modes and routes based on a range of choice criteria. The model is particularly suited for appraising a variety of transportation management measures, especially for the application of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Five example cases including OD demand level, bus frequency, parking fee, information supply and car ownership rate are designed to test the proposed simulation model through a medium-scale case study in Beijing Chaoyang District in China. Computational results illustrate excellent performance and the application of the model to analysis of urban multi-modal transportation networks.
### 13. Stochastic multi-modal transport network under demand uncertainties and adverse weather condition
> This paper proposes a multi-modal transport network assignment model considering uncertainties in both demand and supply sides of the network. These uncertainties are due to adverse weather conditions with different degrees of impacts on different modes. The paper provides the derivations of mean and variance-covariance of the stochastic passenger flows and dis-utility terms involved in the route/mode choice model under the common-line framework. The risk-averse travelers are assumed to consider both the mean and variance of the random perceived travel time on each multi-modal path in their path choice decisions. The model also considers travelers' perception errors by using a Probit stochastic user equilibrium framework which is formulated as fixed point problem. A heuristic solution algorithm is proposed to solve the fixed point problem. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applications of the proposed model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

### 14. Multi-class Multi-modal Network Equilibrium with Regular Choice Behaviors: A General Fixed Point Approach
> In this paper, we propose a new model for the multi-class multi-modal network equilibrium problem, which is a route utility based model, and transfer flows for combined modes are considered specially. The model is formulated as a general fixed point problem. The choice behaviors are assumed regular, which include the common features of deterministic and of continuous with continuous first derivatives additive probabilistic choice models. Users of different classes permit different choice behaviors (including routes, modes, and interchanges), as well as different sets of available routes, modes, and interchanges. Different choice models are explicitly considered; in addition, travel demand of the network can be dealt without using its inverse-unlike the mathematical programming, variational inequality, or complementarity formulations. Existence and uniqueness of the model are analyzed, which extend those conclusions in existed literature.
### 15. Modelling route choice behaviour in multi-modal transport networks
> The paper presents new findings on the influence of multi-modal trip attributes on the quality and competitiveness of inter-urban multi-modal train alternatives. The analysis covers the entire trip from origin to destination, including access and egress legs to and from the train network. The focus is on preferences for different feeder modes, railway station types and train service types as well as on the relative influence of time elements and transfer penalties. Data from dedicated surveys are used including individual objective choice sets of 235 multi-modal homebound trips in which train is the main transport mode. The observed trips have origins and destinations within the Rotterdam-Dordrecht region in The Netherlands with an average total trip time of 50 minutes. Hierarchical Nested Logit models are estimated to take account of unobserved similarities between alternatives at the home-end and the activity-end of the trip respectively, resulting in two-level nesting structures which differentiate between intercity (IC) and non-intercity railway station types at the upper level and between transit and private access modes at the lower level. In order to reflect the multi-dimensional structure of the data a more advanced so-called Multi-Nested GEV model according to the Principles of Differentiation has been estimated which significantly improves the explanatory power and stresses the importance of the home-end of the multi-modal trip.
### 16. THE HIGH-OCCUPANCY VEHICLE LANE DESIGN PROBLEM IN A MULTI-MODAL TRANSPORT NETWORK
> The construction of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes has been regarded as an efficient method to reduce road traffic congestion and to provide car users with additional modal choice. This paper addresses the HOV lane design problem in a general multi-modal transport network. Specifically, given a network of candidate HOV lanes, each existing (general purpose) lane can be converted to a HOV lane or not; also, each established HOV lane can be open to bus only or to both bus and carpooling. In this paper, a bi-level programming model is developed for this HOV design problem. The upper level seeks to minimize the total cost of the multi-modal transport system while the lower level is the multi-modal stochastic traffic assignment model in which the carpooling option is incorporated and the interactions among different modal flows sharing the same road space are captured. A numerical example is used to illustrate that the proposed model can be solved by two heuristic algorithms.
### 17. STOCHASTIC MULTI-MODAL TRANSPORT NETWORK UNDER DEMAND UNCERTAINTIES AND ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITION
> This paper proposes a novel multi-modal transport network assignment model considering uncertainties in both demand and supply sides of the network. These uncertainties are mainly due to adverse weather conditions with different degrees of impacts on different modes. The paper provides the derivation of mean and variance-covariance of stochastic passenger flows and dis-utility terms involved in the route/mode choice model under the common-line framework. The risk-averse travelers are assumed to consider both an average and uncertainty of the random perceived travel time on each multi-modal path in their path choice decisions. The model also considers travelers' perception errors using a Probit stochastic user equilibrium framework formulated as fixed point problem. A heuristic solution algorithm is proposed for solving the fixed point problem. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applications of the proposed model.
### 18. Modelling and managing bus service regularity with influence of prevailing traffic
> This paper presents a multi-modal framework for modelling and analysing different headway control strategies for improving bus service regularity. The interaction between buses and their surrounding traffic is captured in a multi-modal system through a Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of kinematic wave model. This paper further presents a set of signal-based strategies which regulate bus headway through adjusting signal timing plans. The results reveal that the capability of regulating bus headway disturbances through utilising traffic signals is important for maximising bus service regularity and coordinating the bus dynamics with surrounding traffic. This study generates new insights on managing bus reliability and multi-modal traffic in busy urban networks.
### 19. Inferring origin-destination pairs and utility-based travel preferences of shared mobility system users in a multi-modal environment
> This paper presents a methodological framework to identify population-wide traveler type distribution and simultaneously infer individual travelers' Origin-Destination (OD) pairs, based on the individual records of a shared mobility (bike) system use in a multimodal travel environment. Given the information about the travelers' outbound and inbound bike stations under varied price settings, the developed Selective Set Expectation Maximization (SSEM) algorithm infers an underlying distribution of travelers over the given traveler types, or classes, treating each traveler's OD pair as a latent variable; the inferred most likely traveler type for each traveler then informs their most likely OD pair. The experimental results based on simulated data demonstrate high SSEM learning accuracy both on the aggregate and dissagregate levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 20. A general formulation for multi-modal dynamic traffic assignment considering multi-class vehicles, public transit and parking
> Travel behavior and travel cost in modern urban transportation systems are impacted by many aspects including heterogeneous traffic (private cars, freight trucks, buses, etc.) on roads, parking availability near destinations, and travel modes available in the network, such as solo-driving, carpooling, ride-hailing, public transit, and park-and-ride. Managing such a complex multi-modal system requires a holistic modeling framework of transportation network flow in terms of both passenger flow and vehicular flow. In this paper, we formulate and solve for spatio-temporal passenger and vehicular flows in a general multi-modal network explicitly considering multi-class vehicles, parking facilities, and various travel modes. Vehicular flows, namely cars, trucks, and buses, are integrated into a holistic dynamic network loading (DNL) model. Travel behavior of passenger demand on modes and routes choices is encapsulated by a multi-layer nested logit model. We formulate the multi-modal dynamic user equilibrium (MMDUE) that can be cast into a Variational Inequality (VI) problem. A simple flow solution performed at the origin-destination level and based on the gradient projection is derived from the KKT conditions and shown to efficiently solve for the VI problem on large-scale networks. Numerical experiments are conducted on a multi-modal network in the Pittsburgh region along with sensitivity analysis with respect to demand and management strategies. We show that many factors including the total passenger demand, parking prices, transit fare, and ride-sharing impedance can effectively impact the system performance and individual user costs. Experiments on a large-scale multi-modal network in Fresno, California also show our model and solution algorithm have satisfactory convergence performance and computational efficiency.
### 21. Modeling the Effects of Public Bicycle Schemes in a Congested Multi-Modal Road Network
> With increasing concerns about environmental and energy issues in many large Chinese cities, local authorities are introducing public bicycle schemes to promote the use of green transportation modes. This paper proposes a novel model for investigating the effects of the public bicycle schemes in a congested multi-modal road network with auto, bus, and public bicycle travel. The decision-making process of travelers regarding travel modes and route choices is assumed to follow a hierarchical choice structure. The effects of pollution emissions by motorized vehicles (i.e., autos and buses), crowding discomfort in buses, and riding fatigue on bicycles are considered in the proposed model. The multi-modal travel choice equilibrium problem is formulated as an equivalent variational inequality problem. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of the proposed model are examined. A heuristic solution algorithm that combines a diagonalization approach and the method of successive averages is adapted to solve the proposed model. A numerical example is given to illustrate the application of the proposed model and solution algorithm. Findings are reported on the effects of the public bicycle schemes and emission tax policy on the multi-modal transportation system. The optimal public bicycle rental price and emission tax for maximization of social welfare can also be determined by the proposed model.
### 22. Multi-modal management actions for public transport disruptions: an agent-based simulation
> In a public transport disruption, management of the disruption plays a significant role in reducing passengers' inconvenience. This research aims to evaluate how the delay that passengers experience in a public transport disruption can be reduced, using multi-modal management actions. We consider various traffic management actions implemented in real-time to mitigate the downsides of a disruption, including route and mode adjustments, and capacity increase. Transport operators can implement disruption management actions, such as assigning more vehicle capacity/frequency to the running services; and can inform passengers about the disruption. The benefits of providing updated information to mitigate the downsides of the disruption are large, and could possibly lead to a better mode and route choice. The simulation of the impacts and dynamics of a real-life disruption in our study is performed by an agent-based framework. We demonstrate how much delay could be avoided by implementing multi-modal management actions and analyzing the extent to which they change passengers' travel behavior, in terms of travel mode and travel time. Results indicate that employing multi-modal management can lead to a reduction of 18% in the delay of affected passengers, when information and capacity management are used together.
### 23. Modelling impacts of adverse weather conditions on activity-travel pattern scheduling in multi-modal transit networks
> In general, adverse weather has significant influence on individuals' activity/travel choice behaviour and such influence is obviously greater in cities which suffer frequent rainy periods. Thus, the impacts of weather conditions should be taken into account in long-term transit service planning. In this paper, an activity-based network equilibrium model for scheduling daily activity-travel patterns (DATPs) in multi-modal transit networks under adverse weather conditions (with different rainfall intensities) is developed. The interdependency of individuals' activity/travel choices and weather conditions are comprehensively investigated. In the proposed model, the DATP choice problem under adverse weather conditions is transformed into an equivalent static transit assignment problem by constructing a novel super-network platform. A rule-based algorithm is proposed to automatically generate the super-network taking into account the rain effects implicitly. The effects of adverse weather on different transit modes and different activities are explicitly modelled. An efficient solution algorithm without prior enumeration of DATPs is proposed for solving the DATP scheduling problem in multi-modal transit networks. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate application of the proposed model and the solution algorithm.
### 24. A network equilibrium approach for modelling activity-travel pattern scheduling problems in multi-modal transit networks with uncertainty
> An understanding of the interaction between individuals' activities and travel choice behaviour plays an important role in long-term transit service planning. In this paper, an activity-based network equilibrium model for scheduling daily activity-travel patterns (DATPs) in multi-modal transit networks under uncertainty is presented. In the proposed model, the DATP choice problem is transformed into a static traffic assignment problem by constructing a new super-network platform. With the use of the new super-network platform, individuals' activity and travel choices such as time and space coordination, activity location, activity sequence and duration, and route/mode choices, can be simultaneously considered. In order to capture the stochastic characteristics of different activities, activity utilities are assumed in this study to be time-dependent and stochastic in relation to the activity types. A concept of DATP budget utility is proposed for modelling the uncertainty of activity utility. An efficient solution algorithm without prior enumeration of DATPs is developed for solving the DATP scheduling problem in multi-modal transit networks. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the application of the proposed model and the solution algorithm.
### 25. Network equilibrium with combined modes: models and solution algorithms
> In this paper we propose a new model for the equilibrium multi-modal assignment problem with combined modes (MAPCM) for the case of asymmetric costs. MAPCM is stated on a generic passenger assignment equilibrium model, on a generalized traffic assignment model, and on a nested logit distribution as demand model which explicitly takes into account the choice of mode of transport and transfer node among modal networks. This model is formulated as a variational inequality problem in the space of the hyperpath flows and then solved by the disaggregate simplicial decomposition (DSD) algorithm. Illustrations of the model and of the numerical approach are reported on two test networks with asymmetric cost functions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 26. On Modelling Route Choice Sets in Transportation Networks: A Synthesis
> This article reviews a number of topics related to the modelling and generation of route choice sets, specifically for applications in large networks. It synthesizes existing knowledge using a conceptual framework, and addresses in what respects route choice differ from other travel choices. It shows that it is advantageous to distinguish the processes of choice set formation and choice per se, but also to explicitly separate the modelling steps of choice set generation and choice modelling. The article discusses the various purposes for which route choice sets may be used and what these mean for practical choice set modelling. A generic conceptual scheme is presented relating the distinct key elements of the known route choice set generation approaches aimed at their classification and characterization. Some indications for their empirical validity are presented derived from applications to various uni-modal and multi-modal networks.
### 27. Responsive bus dispatching strategy in a multi-modal and multi-directional transportation system: A doubly dynamical approach
> This paper examines the time-dependent bus dispatching problem in a multi-modal context. Traditional studies along this line often optimize the bus frequency or schedule. However, they may fail as the realized bus frequency or schedule is constrained by the time-varying traffic congestion on the road. Adding more buses to service does not necessarily increase the service frequency. Given this, we look into the time-dependent bus dispatching (number of buses in service on road) when taking into account complex multi-modal and multi-directional flow interactions on the road. In particular, the traffic dynamics over clock time is modeled through an aggregate traffic representation with flow interactions between cars and buses, and interactions between traffic in opposite moving directions. Instead of explicitly optimizing the size of dispatched bus fleet, we propose an adaptive fleet size adjustment mechanism where we have a target level of bus loading factor. This adaptive or responsive approach, by taking advantage of the doubly dynamical system proposed in Liu and Geroliminis (2017), adjusts the size of dispatched bus fleet over calendar time and accommodates day-to-day variations of mode choices and traffic patterns. Numerical studies show that the proposed approach can help bus operator to reduce operating cost and improve net benefit while maintaining comparable user costs for passengers. This study offers a new perspective for dynamic bus dispatching strategy and improves our understanding of multi-modal traffic dynamics.
### 28. The use of the path flow estimator in multi-modal networks
> The Path Flow Estimator (PFE) is a software tool for estimating flows and travel times in transportation networks. It has been developed to support both on-line urban traffic management and off-line transportation planning. Given data from vehicle detectors and other forms of sensor or data on Origin-Destination (OD) trips, path flows and path travel times are inferred on the basis of a legit path choice model. Paths are built at each iteration of the program by a least cost procedure, and stored for use in successive iterations. This guarantees the construction of lower cost paths. The delays incurred by congestion are taken into account. The aim of this paper is to discuss how to apply the PFE in multi-modal networks so that path flows are estimated in terms of flows of people and may include trips by different modes. To achieve this last objective it is proposed to extend the network, so that mode-choice is treated in addition and simultaneously to route-choice. This approach guarantees consistency between the two problems and the final results are expected to reflect a stochastic user equilibrium in the multi-modal network. However, generalised costs, which allow trips by different combinations of mode and route to be compared, will have to be carefully designed and calibrated against real data to ensure validity of the model.
### 29. A Stochastic Mixed Traffic Equilibrium Assignment Model Considering User Preferences
> Multi-modal trips are common in urban transportation networks. Traveling preferences are also considered by users in addition to their travel mode, path, cost and time. In this paper, in order to show the behavior of traveling choice under the influence of the cost, time and user preference, a variational inequality model is developed to describe the stochastic multi-user and multi-modal mixed traffic equilibrium. In this model, the mutual influences among different traffic modes are considered in a general traffic network, and travelers are grouped into different user classes according to their socio-economic characteristic and travel behavior. The model is illustrated by an application to a numerical example. Numerical results indicated that the mode choice of users is influenced by some factors such as the cost, time and users preferences for different mode and different transfer station.

### 30. A simplified approach for developing a multi-modal travel planner
> This paper presents a simplified approach for developing a system that would have the ability to coordinate and integrate the diverse sources of information to provide the user with useful information that would not only assist him in planning individual trips, but would aid the user in planning a sequence of daily travel activities. This integrated system would provide the users with a wider range of travel mode, route, destinations, and scheduling options. It will aid its user in planning his daily itinerary by arranging the sequence of stops, suggesting and possibly selecting stop locations, providing transit route and schedule information, and suggesting travel routes. The formulation should consider time constraints, activity needs, real transit service parameters and the actual roadway system. This paper addresses the travel itinerary planning concept which is a variant of the traveling salesman problem.
### 31. New methods of trip planning for travelers of Advanced Public Transport
> A new generation of Trip Planners, at moment most of them at prototypical phase, try to overcome some current limits of these tools, according to new requirements of multi-modal transit networks, to new opportunities offered by the advancements in telematics and to new methodologies in transit network modelling. This paper first explores some aspects of new methods for real-time path choice support with personal tailored information, then a method of normative path suggestion on unreliable multi-modal transit networks, is proposed. For each examined topic, the open research questions and the necessary developments are considered.
### 32. Multi-Attribute, Multi-Class, Trip-Based, Multi-Modal Traffic Network Equilibrium Model: Application to Large-Scale Network
> Transportation systems are dynamically driven not only by non-linear interactions between the different components but also by significant feedbacks between network state and user decision. In this work, we consider a trip-based multi-modal approach to network equilibrium. We assume that mode and path choice is carried out at the same level; therefore, travel time depends on the travel path and the mode attributes of travelers. First, we analyze the existing approaches in the literature to model users' heterogeneity. Second, we present a formulation for static traffic network equilibrium and propose a hybrid formulation of the cost function for trip-based traffic assignment. Third, we consider dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) and propose a variational inequality formulation of the trip-based fixed demand function for the multi-class dynamic traffic equilibrium problem. Finally, we analyze the equilibrium in a large-scale DTA test case (Lyon 6e + Villeurbanne) by a simulation-based approach. Moreover, we propose a novel trip-based algorithm to solve the discrete DTA problem and compare it with the gap function-based method.
### 33. Calibrating a transit assignment model using smart card data in a large-scale multi-modal transit network
> This paper describes a practical automated procedure to calibrate and validate a transit assignment model. An optimization method based on particle swarm algorithm is adopted to minimize a defined error term. This error term which is based on the percentage of root mean square error and the mean absolute percent error encompasses deviation of model outputs from observations considering both segment level as well as the mode level and can be applied to a large scale network. This study is based on the frequency-based assignment model using the concept of optimal strategy while any transit assignment model can be used in the proposed methodological framework. Lastly, the model is validated using another weekday data. The proposed methodology uses automatic fare collection (AFC) data to estimate the origin-destination matrix. This study combines data from three sources: the general transit feed specification, AFC, and a strategic transport model from a large-scale multimodal public transport network. The South-East Queensland (SEQ) network in Australia is used as a case study. The AFC system in SEQ has voluminous and high quality data on passenger boardings and alightings across bus, rail and ferry modes. The results indicate that the proposed procedure can successfully develop a multi-modal transit assignment model at a large scale. Higher dispersions are seen for the bus mode, in contrast to rail and ferry modes. Furthermore, a comparison is made between the strategies used by passengers and the generated strategies by the model between each origin and destination to get more insights about the detailed behaviour of the model. Overall, the analysis indicates that the AFC data is a valuable and rich source in calibrating and validating a transit assignment model.
### 34. The cone projection method of designing controls for transportation networks
> This paper outlines a steady state multi-modal equilibrium transportation model which contains elastic demands and deterministic route-choices. The model may readily be extended to include some stochastic route-choice or mode choice. Capacity constraints and queueing delays are permitted; and signal green-times and prices are explicitly included. The paper shows that, under natural linearity and monotonicity conditions, for fixed control parameters the set of equilibria is the intersection of convex sets. Using this result the paper outlines a method of designing appropriate values for these control parameters; taking account of travellers' choices by supposing that the network is in equilibrium. The method may be applied to non-linear monotone problems by linearising about a current point. An outline justification of the method is given; a rigorous proof of convergence is as yet missing. Thus the method must now be regarded as a heuristic.
### 35. Time Value Distribution and Multi-modal Intercity Travel Network Shape: Theoretical Analysis for the Typical Setting
> In a period of declining demand, should we sustain some intercity transport even if it is unprofitable? And in which situations should we sustain the plurality of modes of transport? In this paper, we analyze the relationship between time-value distribution and multi-modal network shapes. The network shapes considered are dual-mode or single-mode, and a random parameter model is used to describe the route choice of travelers, which takes the time-value distribution into account. First, the relationship between parameters of time-value distribution (i.e., average and dispersion) and the optimal network shape is analyzed; we find that a dual-mode network is optimal when the time-value dispersion is large. Second, as demand declines, the optimal network may change from a dual-mode network to a single-mode network. Third, the conditions in which an equilibrium dual-mode network can be established in a given transport market are described. From a comparison between the equilibrium and optimal conditions for a dual-mode network, we find that dual-mode networks may be in equilibrium even though they are not optimal. It follows that we need not sustain unprofitable mode service in order to realize the optimal network shape. Moreover, in a period of declining demand, it may be beneficial to move from a dual-mode network to a single-mode network from a market driven dual-mode network. (C) 2014 by Elsevier Ltd.
### 36. Improved methods to deduct trip legs and mode from travel surveys using wearable GPS devices: A case study from the Greater Copenhagen area
> GPS data collection has become an important means of investigating travel behaviour. This is because such data ideally provide far more detailed information on route choice and travel patterns over a longer time period than possible from traditional travel survey methods. Wearing a GPS unit is furthermore less requiring for the respondents than filling out (large) questionnaires. It places however high requirements to the post-processing of the data. This study developed and tested a combined fuzzy logic and GIS-based algorithm to process raw GPS data. The algorithm is applied to GPS data collected in the highly complex large-scale multi-modal transport network of the Greater Copenhagen area. It detects trips, trip legs and distinguishes between five modes of transport. The algorithm was validated by comparing with a control questionnaire collected among the same persons and a sensitivity analysis was performed. This showed that the algorithm (i) identified corresponding trip legs for 82% of the reported trip legs, (ii) avoided classifying non-trips such as scatter around activities as trip legs, (iii) identified the correct mode of transport for more than 90% of trip legs, and (iv) were robust towards the specification of the model parameters and thresholds. The method thus makes it possible to use GPS for travel surveys in large-scale multi-modal networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 37. Inferring origin-Destination demand and user preferences in a multi -modal travel environment using automated fare collection
> Eliciting individual travelers' Origin-Destination (OD) information is critical for enabling public transit system policy-makers and operators to serve travelers in a calculated way. Accurate estimation of route choice model parameters is also important, in that it can help assess or predict the service levels that such a system can be expected to achieve. The knowledge of both the OD links and route choice logic is especially in demand for emerging mobility services, where providers work to accommodate individu-alized services and also offer incentives to travelers for specific trips. We show that all this information can be distilled from a particular type of data - the Automated Fare Collection (AFC) system data - in a fast, low-cost way. This paper presents a two-step methodological framework to identify individual travelers' true ODs (beyond stop-level ODs), as well as infer their travel preferences. The key to our work is the ability to identify and process the observations of travelers' routing choices between the same ODs under different travel environment conditions. A presented specially-crafted case study validates the pro-posed method in application with a real-world AFC data of Seoul, Korea, confirming the method's high inferential ability, under a basic route choice model.
### 38. An activity-based approach for scheduling multimodal transit services
> This paper proposes a new activity-based transit assignment model for investigating the scheduling (or timetabling) problem of transit services in multi-modal transit networks. The proposed model can be used to generate the short-term and long-term timetables of multimodal transit lines for transit operations and service planning purposes. The interaction between transit timetables and passenger activity-travel scheduling behaviors is captured by the proposed model, as the activity and travel choices of transit passengers are considered explicitly in terms of departure time choice, activity/trip chain choices, activity duration choice, transit line and mode choices. A heuristic solution algorithm which combines the Hooke-Jeeves method and an iterative supply-demand equilibrium approach is developed to solve the proposed model. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the differences between the activity-based approach and the traditional trip-based method, together with comparison on the effects of optimal timetables with even and uneven headways. It is shown that the passenger travel scheduling pattern derived from the activity-based approach is significantly different from that obtained by the trip-based method, and that a demand-sensitive (with uneven headway) timetable is more efficient than an even-headway timetable.
### 39. Using choice sets for estimation and prediction in route choice
> This article investigates the relationships between choice set types and analysis purpose, especially estimation and prediction. The choice set types considered are generated objective choice sets and observed subjective choice sets. While for estimation purposes subjective choice sets might be preferred, although objective choice sets might have benefits as well, objective choice sets appear to be most suitable for prediction purposes. Empirical analysis of choice sets for multi-modal inter-urban train trips shows clear distinction between choice models estimated using objective choice sets and using subjective choice sets. Applying these choice models for prediction shows that choice models based on subjective choice sets have a poorer performance when applied to objective sets than vice versa. As a result it is recommended to use objective choice sets for both estimation and prediction purposes.
### 40. A bi-level programming for bus lane network design
> This paper proposes a bi-level programming model to solve the design problem for bus lane distribution in multi-modal transport networks. The upper level model aims at minimizing the average travel time of travelers, as well as minimizing the difference of passengers' comfort among all the bus lines by optimizing bus frequencies. The lower level model is a multi-modal transport network equilibrium model for the joint modal split/traffic assignment problem. The column generation algorithm, the branch-and-bound algorithm and the method of successive averages are comprehensively applied in this paper for the solution of the bi-level model. A simple numerical test and an empirical test based on Dalian economic zone are employed to validate the proposed model. The results show that the bi-level model performs well with regard to the objective of reducing travel time costs for all travelers and balancing transit service level among all bus lines.

### 41. Passenger route guidance system for multi-modal transit networks
> In many public transport oriented cities in the world, especially Asian cities, the public transport system has been developed extensively, to the extent that it has become increasingly difficult to navigate. Although inter-modal transfers are common and often necessary, a complete set of the routes across transport modes is generally not presented in a form that is accessible to travelers, as each operator would only publish its own routes. Moreover, the common nonlinear fare tables together with inter-modal fare discounts pose challenges to travelers in deciding their best routes. This study develops a multi-modal passenger route guidance system, called eFinder, to aid travelers with their combined mode-route choices. We discuss the architecture and features of this system in this study. This system forms a platform for disseminating public transit information and should complement further development and use of the public transport network by enabling travelers to make informed choices.
### 42. Sensitivity analysis and its applications for the transit demand in mixed traffic system
> In this paper, an integer linear programming model with the solution algorithm is proposed based on the sensitivity analysis for the multi-modal equilibrium assignment model in order to maximize the transit demand for a mixed traffic system while the maximum allowable expenditures for the transit system is given. A simple numerical example is given to illustrate the applications of the new model.
### 43. Tolls and transit frequencies optimization
> In this paper a tolls and transit frequencies optimization problem has been reduced to a specific equivalent equilibrium assignment problem and its local solution conditions have been stated. A specific fixed-point approach algorithm has also been devised, introducing a hyper-network consisting of a multi-modal transportation network combined with a specific investment network. Based on a test network, a numerical example concerning different scenarios is presented, exhibiting encouraging results.
### 44. A multi-modal competitive hub location pricing problem with customer loyalty and elastic demand
> This paper develops a multi-modal competitive hub location pricing problem whose target is the design of a transportation system for a company that plans to enter into a market with elastic demand, in which an existing transportation company operates its hub-and-spoke network. The entrant company aims to attract customers in the market by convenient locations for its hubs and proper pricing of its transportation services, while customer loyalty is different in the nodes. Hence, mixed-integer programming based on a multi-nominal logit model is proposed. Thereafter, to solve the single allocation hub-and-spoke model, it is decomposed into a bi-level model. In the new structure, the master problem is associated with hub location and assignment decisions, and the sub-problem is associated with pricing decisions. Moreover, upper and lower bounds are calculated to determine the price of transportation routes. Finally, based on a nested approach, a scatter search algorithm is used to search the solution space of the master problem, and a matheuristic method is designed to solve the pricing problem interactively. The proposed approach is employed to solve a case study in the postal service industry of Iran. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 45. Integrated route choice and assignment model for fixed and flexible public transport systems
> The recent technological innovations in various ICT platforms have given rise to innovative mobility solutions. Such systems could potentially address some of the inherent shortcomings of a line/schedule based public transport system. Previous studies either assumed that flexible on-demand services are used as an exclusive door-to-door service or offered as a feeder connection to high-capacity public transport services. However, users may combine line/schedule based public transport systems (Fixed PT) and on-demand services (Flexible PT) so that their travel impedance is minimized. To this end, we propose a multimodal route choice and assignment model that allows users combining Fixed and Flexible PT or use them as individual modes while demand for these services is endogenously determined. The model takes into account the dynamic demand-supply interaction using an iterative learning framework. Flexible public transport can be used to perform any part of the trip, ranging from a first/last mile service to an exclusive direct door-to-door connection. The developed model is implemented in an agent based simulation framework. The model is applied to a network centered around the city of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Scenarios where Fixed PT and Flexible PT are offered as mutually exclusive modes or can be combined into a single journey, are analysed. Results indicate that Flexible PT is predominantly used for covering <30% of the trip length, indicating that it is mainly used as an access or egress mode to Fixed PT. This results with an overall increase in the share of public transport trips. Also, the average waiting time of Flexible PT users when used in combination with Fixed PT are lower than the scenario where each of them is used as an exclusive mode.
### 46. Beyond a complete failure: the impact of partial capacity degradation on public transport network vulnerability
> Disruptions in public transport networks (PTNs) often lead to partial capacity reductions rather than complete closures. This study aims to move beyond the vulnerability analysis of complete failures by investigating the impacts of a range of capacity reductions on PTN performance. The relation between network performance and the degradation of line or link capacities is investigated by establishing a vulnerability curve and related metrics. The analysis framework is applied to a full-scan analysis of planned temporary line-level capacity reductions and an analysis of unplanned link-level capacity reductions on the most central segments in the multi-modal rapid PTN of Stockholm, Sweden. The impacts of capacity reductions are assessed using a non-equilibrium dynamic public transport operations and assignment model. The nonlinear properties of on-board crowding, denied boarding, network effects and route choice result in non-trivial, generally convex, relations which carry implications on disruption planning and real-time management.
### 47. Urban Logistics: Multi-modal Transportation Network Design Accounting for Stochastic Passenger Demand and Freight Logistics
> In this chapter, we present a bi-level optimization model by considering multiple transportation modes, stochastic passenger travel demand and freight logistics. Passenger travel demand can follow a general probability distribution where its mean and variance are function of the population in the origin and destination areas. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. In the lower level, transportation design problem is formulated to minimize traveler costs and in the upper level we consider minimizing carbon monoxide emission and minimizing probability of traffic congestion. The two-stage model is formulated as a single stage model by considering optimality condition of lower level problem as a set of constraints in the upper level model. The formulated single stage model is a Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) problem. In this chapter, a stochastic multi-modal, bi-level optimization model is presented for passenger and freight transportation problem in urban regions.
### 48. The disruption transport model: computing user delays resulting from infrastructure failures for multi-modal passenger & freight traffic
> Transport infrastructure owners are moving from reactive toward proactive infrastructure management. This involves computation of costs associated with failure or maintenance, including expected transport delays. These delays are often computed by multiplying additional travel time by the number of travellers. However, this does not reflect the process of decision-making by travellers using the infrastructure asset, such as mode choices, departure time changes and trip cancellations to reduce time wasted in a traffic jam. Therefore, we introduce a multi-modal transport model that simulates travellers' behaviour after a large-scale infrastructure failure at a critical node in the European TEN-T network. We use a novel approach of modelling the region around the infrastructure disruption in a very detailed manner, whereas the rest of Europe is modelled in a more basic way. This enables us to model impacts of disruptions in high detail, whereas also effects throughout Europe are considered, within reasonable computation time.
### 49. Finding Least Cost Hyperpaths in Multimodal Transit Networks Methodology, Algorithm, and Large-Scale Application
> This paper presents a least cost hyperpath algorithm that captures the complexities that arise in a transit network because of the number of transfers, the standing and overcrowding penalties, the availability of walking and biking in addition to the transit modes, and the mode specific limitations such as availability of bike parking. The problem was formulated as a mathematical program, and then a hybrid label setting correcting algorithm was proposed as a solution. The multi modal time-and approach-dependent algorithm does not require spatial or temporal expansion of the network; this feature results in good computational performance for large-scale applications. Scenario runs performed on the large-scale Chicago Transit Authority network, in Illinois, validate the accuracy and performance of the algorithm.
### 50. Smart card data-centric replication of the multi-modal public transport system in Singapore
> This paper proposes an innovative method of replicating the multi-modal public transport system in Singapore with high precision using smart card database. It replicates the operation of public transport system with known exogenous passenger demand and provides many operational details, including passenger inter-modal trip chains, operational timetable, and detailed transfer behaviour. The paper elaborates on the methodology of the replication including data cleaning, filtering, processing and converting the collected data to meaningful information such as bus journey trajectories and metro system timetable. Thereafter, actualised passenger trip chains are directly assigned to the replicated public transport supply. The resulting replication covers almost 96% of trips made in public transport in Singapore. It provides solid quantitative information on several aspects to support decision making, including precise temporal and spatial travel demand analysis, transfer pattern analysis, traffic condition investigation and bus utilisation analysis.
### 51. INTEGRATED MODELING OF THE EUROPEAN TRADE AND TRANSPORT NETWORK
> Trade and transport statistics are two sides of the same coin. Ideally we would like to have the data on the trade flow between two countries in combination with the information about the split of this flow between various (multi-modal) routes linking the pair of countries. In reality trade and transport statistics are quite difficult to match due to differences in methodology for data collection and the use of surveys. The unification and reconciliation of transport and trade statistics is of great value to both policy makers and the scientific community. The present paper uses the inverse transport network equilibrium problem that simultaneously calculates both the Origin-Destination (OD) matrix of transport flows and estimates the parameters of route choice multinomial logit model on the basis of available transport survey data. The choice of transport network equilibrium model parameters are done in such a way as to minimize the distance between available trade data and the resulting OD matrix. The distance between the two datasets is measured by the entropy function. The methodology presented in this paper has been developed within the framework of the ETIS-Plus project for DG MOVE.
### 52. Day-to-day Dynamics & Equilibrium Stability in A Two-Mode Transport System with Responsive bus Operator Strategies
> This paper presents a day-to-day dynamic analysis of mode choice behaviour in a transportation system. Presented results, regarding a simple two-mode system, support the conjecture that multiple equilibria can likely be observed in such systems. This condition may have a great impact on the design of transit operator strategies.
### 53. An extended model and procedural framework for planning multi-modal passenger journeys
> This paper is concerned with the planning of multiple-leg journeys using public transport services, typically (but not necessarily) in an intra-urban context. The repertoire of transport services may include walking, fixed-route public transport, and demand-responsive modes such as taxis. A journey-planning problem is defined by a request to travel at minimal generalised cost from a given origin to a given destination, subject to timing constraints. The paper presents a comprehensive cost-minimising formulation for such problems, allowing for the possibility of non-linear generalised-cost functions. An optimisation procedure is outlined for problems involving an early-departure style of travel. The new procedure is based on Dijkstra's label-setting shortest-path algorithm, and can be inverted to meet the needs of a late-arrival style of travel. An adaptation to a dilatory or sightseeing style of travel is also possible, but may be problematic with respect to computational performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 54. A route choice model on multimodal transport network
> A new topology model based on MMTN, which consists of a hierarchical multimodal transportation network (HMMTN) model, is proposed in this paper. Based on shortest path algorithm and valid path principle, the authors design a breadth-first searching algorithm and put forward a route choice model on HMMTN. The factors, which affect transfer behavior of travelers, are deeply discussed and route choice model with transfer constraints is programmed into HMMTN. Finally, numeric example is given to test the route choice model.
### 55. Modelling joint activity-travel pattern scheduling problem in multi-modal transit networks
> Over the past decades, many activity-based travel behaviour models have been proposed based on individuals' independent decision making. The modelling of individuals' joint activity/travel choices, however, has received less attention. In reality, both independent and joint activities/travels form individual's normal daily activity-travel patterns. Travel surveys have indicated that joint activity/travel constitutes an important part in individuals' daily activity-travel patterns. On this basis, explicit modelling of joint activity/travel choices is an essential component for long-term transport planning. In this study, an activity-based network equilibrium model is proposed for scheduling two-individual joint activity-travel patterns (JATPs) in congested multi-modal transit networks. The proposed model can be used to comprehensively investigate individuals' activity choices (e.g. activity start time and duration, activity sequence) and travel choices (e.g. departure time, route and mode) in multi-modal transit networks, including both independent ones and joint ones. The time-dependent JATP choice problem is converted into an equivalent static user equilibrium model by constructing a joint-activity-time-space (JATS) super-network platform. Joint travel benefit is modelled by incorporating a commonality factor in the JATP utility. A solution algorithm without prior JATP enumeration is proposed to solve the JATP scheduling problem on the JATS super-network. Numerical results show that individuals' independent and joint activity/travel choices can be simultaneously investigated by the proposed model. The impacts of joint travel benefit on individuals' independent and joint activity-travel choices are explicitly investigated.
### 56. A new general equilibrium model
> In this paper we present a new general equilibrium model appropriate for multi-modal networks. A solution of the model gives the equilibrium distribution of travellers and vehicles over a transportation network. The model is expressed in terms of inverse cost-flow functions; and delays are explicitly modelled. The paper outlines an equilibration algorithm and convergence results for a small network are provided. The equilibrium model has been designed in such a way that optimisation procedures may naturally be added to the equilibration algorithm.
### 57. Application of smart card data in validating a large-scale multi-modal transit assignment model
> The accuracy of transit assignment plays an important role in the successful design and operation of a transit system. The majority of previous studies on validating transit assignment models has used limited survey data or has lacked a large-scale multimodal and high quality dataset. Considering the advantages of smart card [automatic fare collection (AFC)] systems, the aims of this study are to put forward a methodological framework to validate existing transit assignment models and to quantify the performance of these models. Our study combines data from three sources: the General Transit Feed Specification, an AFC system, and a strategic transport model from a large-scale multimodal public transport network, namely the South-East Queensland (SEQ) network in Australia. The AFC system in SEQ has provided a very large and highly accurate dataset on passenger boardings and alightings for the three transit modes of bus, rail and ferry. Following a data analysis, an origin-destination trip matrix is estimated for the AM peak period using AFC data as an input to the transit assignment model. Then, the results of the transit assignment model are compared with the actual passengers' route choices over the same period, at different levels of aggregation. The model performance is quantified by each route (and direction), by each segment of each route (and direction), and by each stop. The results indicate that relatively tighter thresholds are required to validate the transit assignment at the segment level than at the stop level. Furthermore, the validation results indicate that the greatest error is realized for the bus mode, while the level of accuracy in the rail mode is the best. The results suggest a segment-level analysis should be used as the most useful level of aggregation for future calibration and validation of transit assignment models.
### 58. Exact algorithms for multi-criteria multi-modal shortest path with transfer delaying and arriving time-window in urban transit network
> This paper investigates the solution algorithms for the multi-criteria multi-modal shortest path problem (M-SPP), which belongs to the set of problems known as NP-hard, in urban transit network (UTN). The related M-SPP is one of the important and practical problems in several fields such as urban transportation system and freight transportation. The UTN is composed of multiple modes (e.g., automobile, bus, subway, light rail, pedestrian and so on). To get their destination, the passengers can alternate between different modes. As a special demand, the time-window is usually associated with the M-SPP. Because of the service time-limit of modes, the available modes at a stop are varied with the time. So the optimal M-SPP with arriving time-window cannot be simply obtained by finding the optimal M-SPP firstly and then reversely deducing the leaving time-window of the origin according to the arriving time-window of destination. In this paper, the M-SPP with arriving time-window is firstly proposed. To solve the multi-criteria M-SPPs (MM-SPP) with transfer delaying, an improved exact label correcting algorithm (LCA) is designed and, to solve the proposed MM-SPPs with both of transfer delaying and arriving time-window, an exact reverse LCA is designed. Finally, some computing examples are given to test the effectiveness of the designed algorithms. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
### 59. Model formulation and calibration procedure for integrated multi-modal activity routing and network assignment models
> In this paper, a novel transport planning model system (TPMS) is formulated built on the concepts of network, multi-modality, integrity and instant calibration. In the proposed formulation, activity-travel pattern (ATP) choice elements including the choices of activity, activity sequence, mode, departure time, and parking location, are all unified into a time-dependent ATPs generator. The proposed model accounts for the dynamicity of the network, including time-of-day and congestion effects in a joint structure for transport supply and demand. Moreover, the proposed TPMS explicitly formulates an operating capacitated public transport system. To allow visiting locations multiple times and to alleviate the complexity of the proposed model, a novel multi-visit vehicle routing problem is proposed which does not enumerate the node and link visits. In order to calibrate the model based on the major travel attributes of the travel survey data, a set of splitting ratios are introduced to distribute trips on the network. The model uses the splitting ratios to integrate the ATPs generator and the traffic assignment (TA) model in a unified TPMS structure. The effectiveness of the proposed structure is demonstrated through numerical examples provided.
### 60. A review of bicycle-sharing service planning problems
> This paper reviews and systematically classifies the existing literature of bicycle-sharing service planning problems (BSPPs) at strategic, tactical, and operational decision levels with the reference to the novel bicycle sharing service planning process introduced herein. The current research gaps are identified and discussed. The future research directions of the three decision level problems are proposed according to four main categories, namely new diversity, realism, integrality, and technology. This review also points out important future research directions for multi-level BSPPs and the integration of bicycle sharing systems with existing multi-modal transportation systems.
### 61. A COMBINED TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT MODEL FOR MULTIPLE USER CLASSES
> This paper presents a combined trip distribution and assignment model with multiple user classes, in which the trip productions at origins and trip attractions at destinations for each mode are available. In this model, the entropy-type (or gravity-type) trip distribution submodel is incorporated with the user equilibrium assignment problem for multiclass-user transportation networks. The original unsymmetrical link cost functions can be converted to symmetric forms by a 'normalization' procedure, and hence an equivalent convex mathematical programming model is formulated. Two different algorithms based on the Frank-Wolfe's and Evans', respectively are developed and their computational results on test networks are reported. This model is appropriate to be used on congested and multi-modal road networks in which the link travel time is similar for all traffic.
### 62. Maximizing space-time accessibility in multi-modal transit networks: an activity-based approach
> Over the past decades, the impact of transport operating strategy improvements on space-time accessibility, which is an important research area for network design problem, has not been explicitly investigated particularly with the use of activity-based approach. In this paper, a novel activity-based space-time accessibility measure is introduced for considering individuals' accessibility to various activities and travels in a unified super-network framework. A bi-level programming model is proposed for optimizing time-dependent transit line headways and fares in a multi-modal transit network from the activity-based space-time accessibility perspective. In the upper level, transit line headways and fares are optimized by time of day to maximize the network-wide activity-based space-time accessibility. At the lower level, an activity-based network equilibrium model is adapted to provide the resultant activity-travel patterns as reactions to the upper level decision. A simplified network in Hong Kong selected area is used to illustrate the application of the proposed model.
### 63. Bus-based park-and-ride system: a stochastic model on multimodal network with congestion pricing schemes
> This paper focuses on modelling the network flow equilibrium problem on a multimodal transport network with bus-based park-and-ride (P&R) system and congestion pricing charges. The multimodal network has three travel modes: auto mode, transit mode and P&R mode. A continuously distributed value-of-time is assumed to convert toll charges and transit fares to time unit, and the users' route choice behaviour is assumed to follow the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium principle with elastic demand. These two assumptions have caused randomness to the users' generalised travel times on the multimodal network. A comprehensive network framework is first defined for the flow equilibrium problem with consideration of interactions between auto flows and transit (bus) flows. Then, a fixed-point model with unique solution is proposed for the equilibrium flows, which can be solved by a convergent cost averaging method. Finally, the proposed methodology is tested by a network example.
### 64. A simulation-based multiclass, multimodal traffic assignment model with departure time for evaluating traffic control plans of planned special events
> Different types of traffic control plans can be proposed to reduce the traffic impact of planned special events. The simulationbased, multi- class, multi- modal traffic assignment model with departure time windows can be used to forecast the occurrence time and the level of traffic congestion produced by a planned special event. Using Cube Voyager, a mesoscopic and systematic assessment tool is developed to explore participant behaviours of planned special event for mode and departure time window choices, evaluate event scenarios, and duplicate what happened during previous planned special events for a better understanding of the related issues. Peak traffic volumes and traffic congestion generated by the planned special event are successfully estimated in this study. The impacts of a planned special event and the mitigation measures for various traffic control plans are also established successfully in this study. How far restrictions on turning movements are needed, when traffic control needs to start, and what value there is in the headway of feeder buses needs are also determined in these stage-by-stage traffic control plans.

### 65. Multimodal subsidy design for network capacity flexibility optimization
> Transportation networks are facing severe congestion due to the increasing burden of traffic demand and unexpected incidents. Therefore enhancing the network capacity flexibility is the urgent task of transportation managers. Apart from the expansion of road links, economic approaches such as congestion pricing are more effective ways of improving network capacity flexibility. However, congestion pricing often receives objection since it brings excessive travel cost to travelers. A more acceptable economic scheme of adjusting route choice behavior might be offering a subsidy, in a manner of reducing existing charges. In light of this incentive, we propose a solution in the form of multimodal subsidy design with the goal of optimizing network capacity flexibility. To validate the general applicability of the proposed multimodal subsidy schemes, we evaluate and quantify the network capacity flexibility by adopting three different measurement approaches, which are based on the concepts of reserve capacity, total capacity flexibility, and limited capacity flexibility respectively. Three mathematical models are established using these different capacity flexibility measurement approaches, each of which is formulated as a bi-level programming problem. The upper-level problem is to optimize the values of various subsidies, including road link subsidies, parking subsidies, and metro ticket subsidies to enhance the network capacity flexibility. The lower-level problem is a nested-logit based variation inequality program that considers multimode traffic and predicts how drivers and passengers react to the subsidy decision delivered from the upper-level problem. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate how the proposed subsidy schemes affect network capacity flexibility as well as to compare the effects of different subsidy schemes.
### 66. Automated Mobility-on-Demand vs. Mass Transit: A Multi-Modal Activity-Driven Agent-Based Simulation Approach
> Among the new transportation services made possible by the introduction of automated vehicles, automated mobility-on-demand (AMoD) has attracted a lot of attention from both industry and researchers. AMoD provides a service similar to taxi or ride-sharing services, while being driverless. It is expected to attract a huge fraction of travelers currently using mass transit or private vehicles and will have a disruptive effect on urban transportation. While most studies have focused on the operational efficiency of the technology itself, our work aims to investigate its impact on urban mobility. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we present a flexible AMoD modeling and simulation framework developed within a multi-modal agent-based urban simulation platform (SimMobility). The framework allows the detailed simulation and assessment of different AMoD operations together with an activity-based framework that accounts for changes in demand, such as activity participation, trip making, mode, destination, or route choice decisions. Second, we focus our attention on the role of mass transit in a futuristic urban system where AMoD is widely available. Mass transit is already challenged by current ride-sharing services, for example, Uber and Lyft, which provide comparatively better and cheaper services. This trend will plausibly be exacerbated with the introduction of AMoD, which may indirectly act as a replacement to mass transit. Our simulation results show that mass transit is irreplaceable, despite the high efficiency of AMoD, in order to avoid congestion and maintain a sustainable urban transportation system with acceptable levels of service.
### 67. Multimodal route choice models of public transport passengers in the Greater Copenhagen Area
> Understanding route choice behavior is crucial to explain travelers' preferences and to predict traffic flows under different scenarios. A growing body of literature has concentrated on public transport users without, however, concentrating on multimodal public transport networks because of their inherent complexity and challenges. In particular, choice set generation and modeling route choice behavior while accounting for similarity across alternatives and heterogeneity across travelers are non-trivial challenges. This paper tackles these challenges by focusing on the revealed preferences of 5,641 public transport users in the Greater Copenhagen Area. A two-stage approach consisting of choice set generation and route choice model estimation allowed uncovering the preferences of the users of this multimodal large-scale public transport network. The results illustrate the rates of substitution not only of the in-vehicle times for different public transport modes, but also of the other time components (e.g., access, walking, waiting, transfer) composing the door-to-door experience of using a multimodal public transport network, differentiating by trip length and purpose, and accounting for heterogeneity across travelers.
### 68. A path-based greedy algorithm for multi-objective transit routes design with elastic demand
> This paper is concerned with the problem of finding optimal sub-routes from a set of predefined candidate transit routes with the objectives of maximizing transit ridership as well as minimizing operational costs. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) considering transit ridership maximization in a multi-objective bi-level optimization framework; (2) proposing a greedy algorithm for the multi-objective design problem; (3) applying an efficient path-based algorithm to solve the lower level multi-modal traffic assignment problem. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is not only able to approximate the Pareto-optimal solutions with satisfactory accuracy, but also achieves a fast performance even for problems of real-world scale.
### 69. Advanced demand data collection technologies for multi modal strategic modelling
> New data collection technologies have all, but replaced traditional, site-based data collection methods for trip matrix development in the UK. Event data produced by Mobile Network Operators provides adequate information to identify time and location of trip origin and destination (OD), but only limited information on transport mode, vehicle type or trip purpose. In addition, GPS-based data provides another source of OD and user data. This paper describes the mobile phone and app-based demand data collection, verification and processing toward the multi modal strategic transportation model of Chelmsford, UK. The mobile data was collected during 30 days by INRIX, and was processed by Jacobs to develop time-of-day, vehicle type, mode and purpose-specific motorised trip matrices. The mobile phone trip matrices were verified and adjusted against various third party data. A cycle app was developed for Chelmsford to facilitate non-motorised OD data collection by engaging a voluntary user group. Together with other data sources, the data was used to develop cycle OD matrices and to calibrate a cycling route choice model. The paper concludes that the use of mobile phone data provides greater quantity and coverage to develop OD matrices. However, the new data source requires significant effort in post processing and model data segmentation by mode, trip purpose and vehicle type, via applying third party information. The quality and efficiency of this process is likely to improve in the near future, resulting in a step change in the modelling practice. The model was delivered to Essex County Council in April 2017. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

### 70. Modeling multi-modal morning commute in a one-to-one corridor network
> In this paper, we study the morning commute problem with three modes: transit, driving alone and carpool. The transit mode uses its own separate guideway, but the auto modes can access two parallel routes to reach the destination - a freeway and an arterial road (AR). Carpoolers are assumed to share their fuel costs and road tolls, in addition to their advantage of using specially provided facilities (HOV lanes). However, there is an added cost of carpooling: the cost associated with pick-up and drop-off. We analyze the interactions among the three modes and how different factors affect their mode shares and network performance. This is achieved by first deriving the departure time equilibrium for the transit mode (in the same fashion as is done for the auto modes), then establishing equilibrium within each mode. The shares among the modes are determined by a nested logit model. Finally, a time-varying toll on the freeway is proposed to completely eliminate the congestion on the freeway. Some intriguing findings of this study include: (1) enlarging HOV facilities, which offers a travel advantage for carpoolers over solo-drivers, may reduce transit ridership and increase auto travel, and it does not necessarily reduce the total travel cost on the network when the network is highly congested; (2) the rise of gas price may first entice auto commuters to carpool. However, as the gas price increases further, both carpoolers and solo-drivers will eventually switch to use the transit mode; and (3) a flat freeway toll can also reduce the total network travel cost.

### 71. Shared Mobility Problems: A Systematic Review on Types, Variants, Characteristics, and Solution Approaches
> The Shared Mobility Problems (SMP) with the rideshare concept based on sharing a vehicle are fast becoming a trend in many urban cities around the world. Examples of these problems are like ridesharing, carpooling, taxisharing, buspooling, vanpooling, and multi-modal ridesharing. This is the new way to access transportation services by those who are propelling the sharing economy, where access rather than ownership is the new norm. This paper provides a systematic review of SMP using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) method. A total of 110 papers from the last decade are selected from 12 abstracts and citation databases to be reviewed and classified. This is done based on the problem types, variants, characteristics, and solution approaches. The current trends and analysis of the survey findings are also summarised. From this systematic review, it is observed that both the time window and multi-objective problems are popular among the researchers, while the minimisation of the total cost is the main concern in the literature of the SMP. Both static and dynamic cases of the SMP are the most researched where heuristic and metaheuristic approaches are widely adopted by the researchers in the literature. Finally, challenges and suggestions for future work are discussed and highlighted.
### 72. THE NATIONAL TRANSPORT MODEL FOR THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA - DEVELOPMENT OF THE FREIGHT DEMAND MODEL
> National transport model of Croatia (NTMC) consists of network, demand and assignment submodels. Whilst network model (nodes, links, zones) is common, approaches for demand and assignment differ between passenger and freight transport. Each type of transport requires specific methods. This paper describes development of the freight demand model, namely its input data, modelling methods, calibration and validation. The main inputs for modelling of freight transport are socioeconomic data and national statistics on production and trade flows (import / export). Socioeconomic data was collected on the zoning level. For production and import / export, the statistical data was available at national level and was broken down to zoning level according to the socioeconomic data of each zone. Main source for socioeconomic data ( population, employment, working places by economic sector) were national statistics (Croatian Bureau of Statistics). Sources for production data depend of the type of commodity, while import / export data was derived from the national trade statistics. The freight demand model considers all transport modes relevant from a national perspective, i.e. road (HGV and LGV), rail and vessel. The modal freight trip matrices are calculated with a commodity based multi-modal model using an enhanced 4-step approach. For the adequate consideration of commodity-specific affinities, the freight traffic is segmented into 50 different commodities; each of them having specific generation and attraction rates as well as specific modal transport cost rates. The calculation steps of the enhanced 4-step approach are conducted separately for each commodity. The multi-modal freight model, which mainly generates the long-distance trips, is supplemented by a sub-model for generating the freight trips from / to the airports and by a sub-model for the local (short-distance) distribution trips by HGV and LGV.
### 73. Modeling and managing ridesharing in a multi-modal network with an aggregate traffic representation: A doubly dynamical approach
> This study models a multi-modal network with ridesharing services. The developed model reproduces the scenario where travelers with their own cars may choose to be a solo-driver, a ridesharing driver, a ridesharing rider, or a public transit passenger while travelers without their own cars can only choose to be either a ridesharing rider or a public transit passenger. The developed model can capture the (clock) time-dependent choices of travelers and the evolution of traffic conditions, i.e., the within-day traffic dynamics. In particular, the within-day traffic dynamics in a city region is modeled through an aggregate traffic representation, i.e., the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). This paper further develops a doubly dynamical system that examines how the within-day time-dependent travelers' choices and traffic conditions will evolve from day to day, i.e., the day-to-day dynamics. Based on the doubly dynamical framework, this paper proposes two different congestion pricing schemes that aim to reduce network congestion and improve traffic efficiency. One scheme is to price all vehicles including both solo-driving and ridesharing vehicles (for ridesharing trips, the price is shared by the driver and rider), while the other scheme prices the solo-driving vehicles only in order to encourage ridesharing. The pricing levels (under each scheme) can be determined either through an adaptive adjustment mechanism from period to period driven by observed traffic conditions, or through solving a bi-level optimization problem. Numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the models and effectiveness of the pricing schemes. The results indicate that the emerging ridesharing platform may not necessarily reduce traffic congestion, but the proposed congestion pricing schemes can effectively reduce congestion and improve system performance. While pricing solo-driving vehicles only may encourage ridesharing, it can be less effective in reducing the overall congestion when compared to pricing both solo-driving and ridesharing vehicles.
### 74. Calibration of a transit route choice model using revealed population data of smartcard in a multimodal transit network
> One of the major objectives of this study is to provide more realistic and accurate results related to transit passenger's route choice behavior by using population data of revealed preference from smartcard transaction records. The smartcard data of the Seoul city provides both boarding and alighting location and time, which can make possible to trace each passenger's actually used path trajectory with close to 100% market penetration of smartcard usage. This study built an abstract transit network with representative nodes by aggregating all near-by bus stops within walkable distance and with abstract paths by aggregating lines for a specific OD pair that run the same trajectory links by same transit modes. This complex and huge-scale transit network allowed to analyze the route choice behavior of transit passengers in a multimodal transit system that could not be found from the data of relatively small-size cities. This study selected OD pairs which had two or more alternative paths in order to analyze choice behavior requiring a plural alternative choice set. The number of the selected OD pairs are 124,393 pairs that are 33.9% of whole OD pairs that has two or more trip records. The calibration result showed that it is good statistically and logically to include the six explanatory variables in the utility function of the multinomial Logit model. Those are in-vehicle travel time, out-of-vehicle travel time, transfer penalty index, travel time reliability measure, and path circuity index.
### 75. MODELLING INTERMODAL TRIPS IN MULTIMODAL NETWORKS
> This paper describes a multimodal modelling approach, based on combining the networks of all modes in a single interconnected supernetwork. The traditional distinction between mode-choice and route-choice is replaced by route choice in a supernetwork. The paper describes the main steps in a supernetwork approach, i.e. building a supernetwork, generating a realistic set of routes, and modelling route choice given such a set of routes. Supernetwork construction involves splitting public transport nodes, adding intermodal transfer nodes and links, and adding virtual links to facilitate realistic public transport choice analysis. Route set generation is based on combining route sets found for different traveller population segments, having different preference weights and different vehicle availability. The route-choice modelling step may use choice models that adequately deal with route-overlap. The paper shows the results for a real world application in a multimodal corridor in The Netherlands.
### 76. Modelling intermodal travel in Switzerland: A recursive logit approach
> We use data from the Swiss national household travel survey to 1. analyze the socioeconomic determinants for intermodal travel in Switzerland and 2. estimate a first large-scale multimodal recursive logit route choice model for urban trip making. We show that intermodal travel is mostly associated with ownership of transit subscriptions, which allow free at the point-of-use public transportation. We also present a framework using open-source data to generate the multimodal network for the recursive logit model estimation. The fact that the model only needs a multimodal network to model the transport supply makes it independent of path sampling algorithms for the choice-set construction and it thus provides an alternative to classic mode and route choice models, since it can estimate mode and route choice parameters with directly observed routes, removing the sampling bias. By eliminating the need to sample alternative paths for estimation, it also simplifies the estimation process, making it a viable choice as an integral solution for joint route and mode choice modelling.
### 77. Multi-modal and demand-responsive passenger transport systems: a modelling framework with embedded control systems
> The LITRES-2 modelling system provides a framework for investigating the performance of urban passenger transport systems, with particular attention to demand-responsive transport modes and. traveller information technologies. The modes covered include conventional timetabled services (buses, trains etc.), taxis (both single- and multiple-hire), and other demand-responsive services. Tables of estimated aggregate demand are disaggregated so as to produce a stream of fully-articulated travel-requests. Individual requests are resolved as single- or multiple-leg journeys, through the use of request-broking and journey-planning modules that seek to minimise travellers' generalised costs. Journey-legs allocated to demand-responsive modes are handled by a fleet-scheduling module which includes provision for instantaneous as well as advance-notice bookings, and for contingent situations such as breakdowns and passenger no-shows. The fleet-scheduling and journey-planning modules are designed as embedded control systems and are intended for use in real-time as well as modelling applications. The paper describes the main analytical and procedural components of LITRES-2, and assesses some methodological issues arising from experience in recent planning studies. The system appears to be well suited for use in modelling situations where the critical issues are concerned with the supply rather than demand side of transportation activity.

### 78. Modelling urban traffic dynamics based upon the variational formulation of kinematic waves
> This paper presents a dynamic traffic modelling framework based on the variational formulation of kinematic waves. We compare the effectiveness of this relatively recent numerical method with the traditional Godunov-based cell transmission method on various aspects including modelling shocks, dispersion of vehicle platoons, moving bottlenecks, and traffic characteristics with respect to real-world observations made in Central London, UK. The results suggest that the variational method is able to produce high-quality estimates both theoretically and empirically. This study opens up a new research direction in the area of urban traffic modelling and optimisation.
### 79. Using connectivity for measuring equity in transit provision
> This study proposes the assessment of equity in transit provision by using transit connectivity as a comprehensive impedance measure. Transit connectivity considers in-vehicle time, access/egress times, waiting time, service reliability, frequency, and 'seamless' transfers along multi-modal paths. In addition, transit connectivity weighs the impedance components according to their relative importance to travelers. The assessment of equity was performed for the multi-modal transit system in the Greater Copenhagen Area, renowned for its transit-oriented finger-plan. The assessment method used a GIS representation of the network (i.e., service lines, timetables, metro stations, train stations, and bus stops), and transit assignment results (i.e., level-of-service times, passenger flows). The assessment method proved effective in calculating location-based and potential-accessibility measures and Gini coefficients of inequality in the Greater Copenhagen Area. Results show that the transit-oriented development contributes to spatial equity with high connectivity in densely populated zones, vertical equity with comparable connectivity in high income and low income zones, inter-generational equity with good connectivity provision for students to higher-education and job opportunities. Also, results show that the north-west 'finger' is less equitable with lower connectivity for low population density and lower connectivity to higher-education opportunities regardless of the high number of students.

### 80. From Traditional to Automated Mobility on Demand: A Comprehensive Framework for Modeling On-Demand Services in SimMobility
> Mobility on demand (MoD) systems have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for sustainable personal urban mobility in cities. In the context of multi-agent simulation technology, the state-of-the-art lacks a platform that captures the dynamics between decentralized driver decision-making and the centralized coordinated decision-making. This work aims to fill this gap by introducing a comprehensive framework that models various facets of MoD, namely heterogeneous MoD driver decision-making and coordinated fleet management within SimMobility, an agent- and activity-based demand model integrated with a dynamic multi-modal network assignment model. To facilitate such a study, we propose an event-based modeling framework. Behavioral models were estimated to characterize the decision-making of drivers using a GPS dataset from a major MoD fleet operator in Singapore. The proposed framework was designed to accommodate behaviors of multiple on-demand services such as traditional MoD, Lyft-like services, and automated MoD (AMoD) services which interact with traffic simulators and a multi-modal transportation network. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework through a large-scale case study in Singapore comparing the fully decentralized traditional MoD with the future AMoD services in a realistic simulation setting. We found that AMoD results in a more efficient service even with increased demand. Parking strategies and fleet sizes will also have an effect on user satisfaction and network performance.
### 81. A POSTERIORI APPROACH TO TRAVEL CHOICE MODELING IN MULTIMODAL TRANSPORT NETWORKS
> This paper presents a model,architecture for multimodal transport modeling based on the supernetwork concept. After consideration of literature, it turns out that the classical network model architecture can be adapted to handle multimodal transport modeling with minor changes, and that the classical concept of network equilibrium is equally applicable in a multimodal transport setting when multimodal transport is cast as travel through a supernetwork. Choice-set generation for route-choice modeling is known as a difficult problem. In this paper we report on the use of stochastic route-finding based on the path utility defined by a recently estimated logit model for route-choice in multimodal networks to efficiently generate plausible routes through a multimodal transport network. To show the feasibility of our approach, we have built the multimodal supernetwork for the Dordrecht-Rotterdam corridor and applied the proposed model system.
### 82. Activity Cancellation and Rescheduling by Stressed Households Improving Convergence in Integrated Activity-Based and Dynamic Traffic Assignment Models
> Maintaining consistency between individuals' activity choices and realistic network conditions is made possible through a unified framework of activity-based and dynamic traffic assignment models. In this study, a model formulation and solution approach is presented fur an integrated system of household activity schedule adjustment and multi-modal dynamic traffic assignment model. In the proposed framework, individuals are initially assigned an activity pattern that includes their activity start time, end time, sequence, and number of intermediate and final destinations. The planned schedules are loaded to the network and executed to obtain the dynamic traffic conditions. Next, the individuals who experience schedules inconsistent with the planned ones try to adjust their activity durations or trip departure times to accommodate the fluctuations. In some cases, however, the schedule inconsistencies may not be resolved through departure time or duration adjustments; therefore, the traveler may cancel an activity or trip as a response to the fluctuations. Strategies for selecting activities to be canceled are discussed, and the influence of incorporating activity cancellation on numerical convergence is presented.
### 83. A large scale stochastic multi-class schedule-based transit model with random coefficients - Implementation and algorithms
> Public transport assignment models are increasing in complexity in order to describe passengers' route choices as detailed and correctly as possible. Important trends in the development are 1) schedule-based models, 2) inclusion of feeder modes, 3) use of stochastic components to describe differences in passengers' preferences within and between trip purposes and classes, as well as to describe non-explained variation within a utility theory framework, and 4) consideration of capacity problems at coach level, system level and terminal level. In the East Denmark Model, such a large-scale transit assignment model was developed and estimated within a Stochastic User Equilibrium framework solved by the Method of Successive Averages. The model covered a metropolitan area including its hinterland (2,000 lines, 50,000 runs, 300,000 stops, and 1 million nodes and 10 million arcs in the calculation graph). The paper outlines the experiences from this project, and the subsequent research and development using the case as 'modelling laboratory'. The main focus of the paper is to describe the estimation of the utility functions, and to discuss and suggest optimisation of the solution algorithm.
### 84. Cone fields and the cone projection method of designing signal settings and prices for transportation networks
> This paper builds on ideas in Smale [13] and Smith et. al. [11, 12]. The paper utilises Smale's cone fields rather than vector fields to impel disequilibrium steady state traffic-price-green-time distributions; and applies these ideas to the design of steady state signal controls and prices on transportation networks. The work is applied within a multi-modal equilibrium transportation model which contains elastic demands and deterministic choices. The model may readily be extended to include some stochastic route-choice or mode choice. Capacity constraints and queueing delays are permitted; and signal green-times and prices are explicitly included. The paper shows that, under natural linearity and monotonicity conditions, for fixed control parameters the set of equilibria is the intersection of convex sets. Using this result the paper outlines a cone field method of calculating equilibria and also an associated method of designing appropriate values for the control parameters; taking account of travellers' choices by supposing that the network is in equilibrium. The method is shown to apply to certain non-linear monotone problems by linearising about a current point.
### 85. Application of constrained enumeration approach to Multimodal choice set generation
> Collected data often include only information about chosen routes. To gain insight into travelers' route choice behavior or to predict route shares, one must know the set of alternatives from which travelers have chosen their routes. An alternative approach to choice set generation in mixed multimodal networks is presented. This new algorithm-a run-based, constrained enumeration method that uses branch-and-bound techniques-is suitable for both estimation and prediction. One key characteristic of the algorithm is a set of constraints that reflects observed travel behavior. The proposed algorithm for choice set generation can be applied to a complete multimodal network at once. However, by exploiting knowledge about the structure of multimodal trips, the separate application of the algorithm to partial networks and consecutive concatenation of subroutes into complete door-to-door routes substantially reduce computation times without resulting in incomplete choice sets. This algorithm for choice set generation has been calibrated for and successfully applied to a real-size, mixed multimodal transport network in the Netherlands. A comparison of generated choice sets with reported chosen and known alternatives indicated that the algorithm can generate these alternatives, with high coverage levels as a result. This result clearly indicates that this constrained enumeration approach meets the requirements for choice set generation and thus offers interesting perspectives for route choice analysis and the prediction of route shares. Furthermore, the separate application of the algorithm to partial networks and the consecutive concatenation of subroutes into complete door-to-door trips substantially do not result in incomplete choice sets.
### 86. A real-time algorithm to solve the peer-to-peer ride-matching problem in a flexible ridesharing system
> Real-time peer-to-peer ridesharing is a promising mode of transportation that has gained popularity during the recent years thanks to the wide-spread use of smart phones, mobile application development platforms, and online payment systems. An assignment of drivers to riders, known as the ride-matching problem, is a central component of a peer to-peer ridesharing system. In this paper we discuss the features of a flexible ridesharing system and propose an algorithm to optimally solve the ride-matching problem in a flexible ridesharing system in real-time. We generate random instances of the problem, and perform sensitivity analysis over some of the important parameters in a ridesharing system. Furthermore, we discuss two novel approaches to increase the performance of a ridesharing system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 87. A Two-Phase Gradient Projection Algorithm for Solving the Combined Modal Split and Traffic Assignment Problem with Nested Logit Function
> This study provides a gradient projection (GP) algorithm to solve the combined modal split and traffic assignment (CMSTA) problem. The nested logit (NL) model is used to consider the mode correlation under the user equilibrium (UE) route choice condition. Specifically, a two-phase GP algorithm is developed to handle the hierarchical structure of the NL model in the CMSTA problem. The Seoul transportation network in Korea is adopted to demonstrate an applicability in a large-scale multimodal transportation network. The results show that the proposed GP solution algorithm outperforms the method of the successive averages (MSA) algorithm and the classical Evan's algorithm.
### 88. Path size modeling in multimodal route choice analysis
> Travelers in multimodal networks make many choices (e.g., main mode, access modes, egress modes, boarding nodes, transfer nodes, and egress nodes). One way to address this complexity of choices is to analyze choice sets of multimodal routes. However, choice sets for multimodal networks are large, and overlap of routes within choice sets is substantial. This paper focuses on overlap in multimodal transport networks. An overview of the topic of overlap and route choice modeling is given and is followed by an analysis of how overlap might be defined in the context of multimodal networks. Three definitions of overlap are proposed, based on number of legs, time, or distance. The different definitions are analyzed using path size logit estimations, which show that path size must be accounted for. Furthermore, the definition of path size for multimodal transport networks should be different from that used for road networks: for multimodal transport networks, a definition using number of legs yields substantially better results. Estimation results suggest that the weighting parameter corresponding with the path size variable should be equal to 1, implying that the path size variable based on number of legs accounts for the correlation of error terms of overlapping parts.
### 89. Development of a Multimodal Microsimulation-Based Evacuation Model
> This study presents a multimodal evacuation microsimulation modeling framework. The paper first determines optimum marshal point locations and transit routes, then examines network conditions through traffic microsimulation of a mass evacuation of the Halifax Peninsula, Canada. The proposed optimization modeling approach identifies marshal point locations based on transit demand obtained from a Halifax Regional Transport network model. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) technique is used to formulate the marshal point location and transit route choice problem. The study proposes a novel approach to solving the MILP problem, using the branch and cut algorithm, which demonstrates superiority in computation time and production of quality solutions. The optimization model determines 135 marshal points and 12 transit routes to evacuate approximately 8,400 transit-dependent individuals. Transit demand and marshal point locations are found to be concentrated at the core of the peninsula. The microsimulation modeling takes a dynamic traffic assignment-based approach. The simulation model predicts that it takes 22 h to evacuate all auto users but just 7 h for the transit-dependent population. The study reveals that the transit system has excess capacity to assist evacuees who switch from auto and other modes. Local traffic congestion prolongs the evacuation of a few densely-populated zones in the downtown core of the peninsula. The findings of this research help policy-makers understand the impacts of marshal point locations and transit route choice decisions on multimodal evacuation performance, and provide insights into emergency planning of multimodal evacuations under mode switch and transit-based evacuation scenarios.
### 90. A method of emission and traveller behavior analysis under multimodal traffic condition
> The growth of urban traffic in recent decades has led to environmental problems in terms of increased emissions. In some cities located along waterfronts, multimodal transportation that includes ferry trips plays an important role in public transportation. Compared with roadway traffic, ferry service can often provide shorter routes between given origins and destinations as well as reduce emissions. However, in some areas with high ferry demand, travel delay occurs frequently because of traffic congestion caused by drivers waiting to board the ferry, which can significantly increase travel time and decrease its reliability. In addition, changes in other factors, such as fuel prices, also may influence drivers' decision making processes in terms of route choice. In this paper, a study focusing on travel time and travel time reliability of ferry service during peak travel periods is performed. Furthermore, as a key result an emission loss model under multimodal conditions is developed that also takes travel cost into account. The analysis of route choice is conducted based on a mixed logit model which is able to handle individual preference. Based upon validation with data from the Seattle area, the proposed model is verified as an efficient way to analyse emission factors in a multimodal transportation environment.

### 91. Impacts of real-time information levels in public transport: A large-scale case study using an adaptive passenger path choice model
> Public transport services are often uncertain, causing passengers' travel times and routes to vary from day to day. However, since door-to-door passenger delays depend on both intended and realised routes, they are difficult to calculate, as opposed to vehicle delays which can be derived directly from the widely available Automated Vehicle Location (AVL) data of the public transport system. In this study we use three months of such historical AVL data to calculate corresponding realised routes and passengers delays in a large-scale, multi-modal transport network by formulating and implementing an adaptive passenger path choice model in an agent-based scenario of Metropolitan Copenhagen with 801,719 daily trips. The proposed model allows analysing five different levels of real-time information provision, ranging from no information at all to global real-time information being available everywhere. The results of more than 258 million (positive or negative) passenger delays show that variability of passengers' travel time is considerable and much larger than that of the public transport vehicles. It is also shown that obtaining global real-time information at the beginning of the trip reduces passengers delay dramatically, although still being inferior to receiving such along the trip. Additionally, being able to automatically obtain real-time passenger information while walking and being on-board public transport services is found not to lead to considerable improvements compared to acquiring such information manually while waiting at stops, although slight benefits are demonstrated in supplementary models run with pseudo-intelligent vehicle delay forecasting.
### 92. A demand model with departure time choice for within-day dynamic traffic assignment
> A within-clay dynamic demand model is formulated, embodying, in addition to the classic generation, distribution and modal split stages, an actual demand model taking into account departure time choice. The work focuses on this last stage, represented through an extension of the discrete choice framework to a continuous choice set. The dynamic multimodal supply and equilibrium model based on implicit path enumeration, which have been developed in previous work are outlined here, to define within-day dynamic elastic demand stochastic multimodal equilibrium as a fixed point problem on users flows and transit line frequencies. A MSA algorithm capable, in the case of Logit route choice models, of supplying equilibrium flows and frequencies on real dimension networks, is presented, as well as the specific procedures implementing the departure time choice and actual demand models. Finally, the results obtained on a test network are presented and conclusions are drawn. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
### 93. Dynamic micro-assignment modeling approach for integrated multimodal urban corridor management
> Development and analysis of demand management strategies for integrated multimodal urban corridor management requires application of a new generation of demand modeling and network analysis tools. This paper describes the development of a dynamic trip micro-assignment and (meso) simulation system that incorporates individual tripmaker choices of travel mode, departure time and route in multimodal urban transportation networks (with different travel modes such as drive alone, shared ride, bus rapid transit and metro rail). These travel choice dimensions arc integrated in a stochastic utility maximization framework that considers multiple user decision criteria such as travel time, travel cost, schedule delay, as well as travel time reliability. A variational inequality model is first proposed to describe the general stochastic dynamic traffic user equilibrium problem. For a typical case that assumes the logit-based alternative choice model, this paper develops an equivalent gap function-based optimization formulation and a heuristic iterative solution procedure. Based on a multidimensional network representation, an efficient time-dependent least cost path algorithm is embedded to generate an intermodal route choice set that recognizes time-dependent mode transfer costs and feasible mode transfer sequences. A two-stage estimation procedure that can systematically utilize historical static demand information, time-dependent link counts, as well as empirically calibrated stochastic departure time choice models is proposed to infer commuters' preferred arrival time distribution, which is important in modeling departure time choice dynamics. A case study based on a large-scale multimodal transportation network (adapted from the Baltimore-Washington corridor) is presented to illustrate the capabilities of the methodology and provide insight into the potential benefit of integrated multimodal corridor management.

### 94. Park-and-ride service design under a price-based tradable credits scheme in a linear monocentric city
> This study conducts a multimodal analysis in a competitive railway/highway system along a linear traffic corridor. A price-based tradable credits scheme is introduced into the park-and-ride (P&R) design in which the credit price is determined by the government. The C-logit model is used to analyze the linear monocentric city's route choice behavior. A bi-level programming model is proposed to study the P&R location problem. The upper level minimizes the social cost by optimizing the quantity and location of P&R stations and the price-based tradable credits scheme. The lower level is to determine the equilibrium assignments on the multi-mode network. Finally, a numerical example is used to investigate the effects of the price-based tradable credits scheme, bodily congestion in transit carriages and P&R facilities' investment on social cost, traveler behavior and P&R locations. It is found that besides the price-based tradable credits scheme, bodily congestion and P&R facilities investment also have an important influence on the P&R location design and the social cost.
### 95. Merging transit schedule information with a planning network to perform dynamic multimodal assignment: lessons from a case study of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area
> Traffic assignment has traditionally been performed using aggregate static user equilibrium approaches for a single mode. These approaches are typically favoured over more complex dynamic multimodal micro and meso-simulated models. Investigations into dynamic multimodal assignment models have shown promise, prompting interest in the adoption of complex modelling structures. The development and operation of these complex models can still be problematic, highlighting the need for efficient approaches to allow practitioners to acquire and apply these models. This paper presents a method to modify existing static auto assignment networks for dynamic multimodal assignment. To complement this, a method, which improves the overall performance of the transit routing procedure used within many assignment models, is presented. These methods were tested using data from the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, and result in an assignment procedure with reasonable run time and results, suggesting potential for wide spread adoption of these approaches.
### 96. Integrated planning of park-and-ride facilities and transit service
> This paper proposes an integrated planning framework to locate park-and-ride (P&R) facilities and optimize their capacities as well as transit service frequencies simultaneously. P&R users' route choice behavior is explicitly considered, and a link-based multimodal user equilibrium model is established. The optimal location and capacity of P&R facilities and transit service design problem is formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC), and a solution algorithm based on the active-set approach is developed to solve the optimal design problem effectively. A numerical example is employed to demonstrate that the optimal design shifts commuters from the automobile mode to transit and P&R modes and, hence improves the net social benefit dramatically.

### 97. The bicriterion multimodal assignment problem: Introduction, analysis, and experimental results
> We consider the bicriterion multimodal assignment problem, which is a new generalization of the classical linear assignment problem. A two-phase solution method using an effective ranking scheme is presented. The algorithm is valid for generating all nondominated criterion points or an approximation. Extensive computational results are conducted on a large library of test instances to test the performance of the algorithm and to identify hard test instances. Also, test results of the algorithm applied to the bicriterion assignment problem are provided.
### 98. Large-scale application of MILATRAS: case study of the Toronto transit network
> This paper documents the efforts to operationalize the conceptual framework of MIcrosimulation Learning-based Approach to TRansit Assignment (MILATRAS) and its component models of departure time and path choices. It presents a large-scale real-world application, namely the multi-modal transit network of Toronto which is operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). This large-scale network is represented by over 500 branches with more than 10,000 stops. About 332,000 passenger-agents are modelled to represent the demand for the TTC in the AM peak period. A learning-based departure time and path choice model was adopted using the concept of mental models for the modelling of the transit assignment problem. The choice model parameters were calibrated such that the entropy of the simulated route loads was optimized with reference to the observed route loads, and validated with individual choices. A Parallel Genetic Algorithm engine was used for the parameter calibration process. The modelled route loads, based on the calibrated parameters, greatly approximate the distribution underlying the observed loads. 75% of the exact sequence of transfer point choices were correctly predicted by the off-stop/on-stop choice mechanism. The model predictability of the exact sequence of route transfers was about 60%. In this application, transit passengers were assumed to plan their transit trip based on their experience with the transportation network; with no prior (or perfect) knowledge of service performance.
### 99. Relevance of detailed transfer attributes in large-scale multimodal route choice models for metropolitan public transport passengers
> Given the aim of increasing public transport patronage, it is important to understand how passengers perceive different trip characteristics. Most of the existing studies about public transport demand and route choice assigned a higher value of time to transfers than in-vehicle time and used a general transfer penalty to capture an average increase in the travel disutility because of the amount of transfers. However, it is likely that there are nuances to the transfer behaviour depending on specific transfer conditions that existing models do not capture and hence it is difficult to evaluate measures aimed at improving transfers to make public transport more attractive. This study presents a route choice model for the large-scale multimodal public transport network in the Greater Copenhagen Region where a variety of transfer attributes were explicitly considered within a unified model framework. The model was estimated on an extensive revealed dataset of 4,810 observed routes that made it possible to evaluate the rates of substitution of transfer related attributes. The results revealed that travellers do consider attributes for transfers such as ease of wayfinding, presence of shops and escalators at stations when choosing routes in the public transport network and this influences the attractiveness of the respective routes with a quite large range of the transfer penalty from 5.4 min compared to bus in-vehicle time for the best possible transfer to 12.1 min for the worst. Furthermore, the study revealed some differences in the preferences for transfer attributes across passengers. This suggest a quite large potential for improving transfers and hence public transport patronage focusing on the attributes of the transfers.
### 100. Markovian traffic equilibrium
> We analyze an equilibrium model for traffic networks based on stochastic dynamic programming. In this model passengers move towards their destinations by a sequential process of arc selection based on a discrete choice model at every intermediate node in their trip. Route selection is the outcome of this sequential process while network flows correspond to the invariant measures of the underlying Markov chains. The approach may handle different discrete choice models at every node, including the possibility of mixing deterministic and stochastic distribution rules. It can also be used over a multi-modal network in order to model the simultaneous selection of mode and route, as well as to treat the case of elastic demands. We establish the existence of a unique equilibrium, which is characterized as the solution of an unconstrained strictly convex minimization problem of low dimension. We report some numerical experiences comparing the performance of the method of successive averages (MSA) and Newton's method on one small and one large network, providing a formal convergence proof for MSA.
### 101. Congestion pricing for multi-modal transportation systems
> In this paper, we extend the toll pricing framework previously developed for vehicular traffic networks to ones with the potential to include many modes of transportation such as walking, driving, and using public conveyance (e.g., buses, subways, and trains). To determine tolls, we construct a user equilibrium and system optimal model. In both models, we assume that users adopt strategies or hyperpaths to travel between each origin-destination pair and the demand between each pair is fixed. However, the choice between driving and using public transportation is determined by a binomial logit function. As in the case of vehicular traffic networks, the set of valid tolls can be obtained from the solution to the system problem and the equilibrium conditions for the user problem. Then, secondary objective functions similar to those for traffic networks can be used to select a toll vector for, e.g., implementation. We provide a numerical example to illustrate our approach.

### 102. Bilevel programming applied to optimising urban transportation
> This paper outlines a multi-modal, elastic, equilibrium transportation model in which signal green-times and prices charged to traverse a route (public transport fares, parking charges or road-use charges) are explicitly included. An algorithm is specified which, for a fairly general objective function, continually moves current traffic flows, green-times and prices within the model toward locally optimal values while taking account of users' responses. The directions of movement of current traffic flows, green-times and prices are determined by solving linear approximations to the actual problem. The results of applying a simplified form of the algorithm to a small network model with five routes and two signal-controlled junctions are given. It is proved that under realistic conditions the sequence of (traffic flows, green-times, prices) triples generated by the algorithm does indeed approach those triples which possess a reasonable local optimality property. However the optimal control problem discussed here is non-convex and just a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point is the answer sought. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 103. Dynamic network simulation-assignment platform for multiproduct intermodal freight transportation analysis
> This paper develops a dynamic freight network simulation-assignment platform for the analysis of multiproduct intermodal freight transportation systems. At the core of the platform is a model framework for the mode-path assignment problem in multimodal freight transportation networks. The framework consists of three main components: a multimodal freight network simulation component, a multimodal freight assignment component, and a multiple product intermodal shortest path procedure. The freight network simulation component incorporates a bulk queuing model to evaluate transfer delay experienced by shipments at intermodal transfer terminals, classification yards, and ports. The multimodal freight assignment component determines the network flow pattern from a mode-path alternative set calculated by the multiple product intermodal shortest path procedure, based on the link travel costs and node transfer delays from the multimodal freight network simulation component. This model can represent individual shipment mode-path choice behavior, consolidation policy, conveyance link moving, and individual shipment terminal transfer in an iterative solution framework.
### 104. Hyperpaths in Network Based on Transit Schedules
> The concept of a hyperpath was introduced for handling passenger strategies in route choice behavior for public transit, especially in a frequency-based transit service environment. This model for handling route choice behavior has been widely used for planning transit services, and hyperpaths are now applied in areas beyond public transit. A hyperpath representing more specific passenger behaviors on a network based on transit schedules is proposed. A link-based time-expanded (LBTE) network for transit schedules is introduced; in the network each link represents a scheduled vehicle trip (or trip segment) with departure time and travel time (or arrival time) between two consecutive stops. The proposed LBTE network reduces the effort to build a network based on transit schedules because the network is expanded with scheduled links. A link-based representation of a hypergraph with existing hyperpath model properties that is directly integrated with the LBTE network is also proposed. Transit passenger behavior was incorporated for transfers in the link-based hyperpath. The efficiency of the proposed hyperpath model was demonstrated. The proposed models were applied on a test network and a real transit network represented by the general specification of Google's transit feed.
### 105. Multi entity perspective freight demand modeling technique: Varying objectives and outcomes
> The importance of freight transportation modeling and forecasting to better address planning issues is well recognized by policy makers. Compared to advancement in travel demand modeling for passenger travel, however, current freight demand modeling methods are not yet in the adequate levels to assess increasingly complex and important planning and policy issues. Three most important players in freight demand modeling are (a) shippers, (b) planners, and (c) policy (decision) makers who have different objectives. Past research is limited in proposing a unified methodology to address the objective of each player and to assess performance of transportation networks under conditions to achieve such objectives. In this paper, freight demand modeling is designed to address each objective of the three players in a multimodal transportation network. A freight transportation model that combines three geographic scales national, state, and local is proposed and developed to capture different characteristics of short- and long-distance freight flows with a focus on state-level modeling in Maryland. Data for the model include freight flows by commodity and by Freight Analysis Framework (FAF) zones, which are further disaggregated to Statewide Modeling Zones in Maryland; a transportation network with detailed link level attributes; user costs in addition to all details needed for the travel demand model. In the modeling framework autos are simulated simultaneously with trucks in a multi-class user equilibrium traffic assignment. The results demonstrate the network performance and key information on travel characteristics for each player. The proposed tool can be used for freight travel demand modeling for analyzing impacts of policies at state, county and local levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 106. Bi-level Programming Model for Exclusive Bus Lanes Configuration in Multimodal Traffic Network
> Setting exclusive bus lanes (EBLs) on existing roads is a major measure to practise bus priority. However, the capacities for different vehicles will be changed with such strategies and then the travel times of different modes will be also changed. Accordingly, the presence of EBLs may be associated with significant impacts on the travellers' mode choices and the performance of the whole traffic network, especially in a congested condition. This paper attempts to propose a EBLs design model for multimodal traffic network, in which the total travel cost of all travellers in network is regarded as the optimization objective. Firstly, this paper analyses the effects of EBLs on the capacities for transit vehicles and private cars and formulates the corresponding impedance functions based on the travel demand. The complex travellers' choice behaviours (including mode choice and route choice) are analysed and a variational inequality model is then proposed to describe user equilibrium assignment problem in multimodal network. Further, a bi-level programming model is proposed to describe the EBLs design problem. The branch and bound algorithm is then given for solving the proposed bi-level problem. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of such model and algorithm. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
### 107. Dynamic assignment with user information in multimodal networks
> The dynamic assignment of users has been widely studied for the road network while it is less considered for multimodal networks. In this article, we investigate the dynamic assignment of users in multimodal transportation systems while differentiating between informed and uninformed users. The problem is modeled as a multiagent system where we consider all of the modes that share the road infrastructure (private vehicles, taxis, buses, tramway, electric car sharing services), thus the users and vehicles of each mode are represented by an agent. As mentioned in the above, we consider two types of users: informed and uninformed. Our objective is to assess the impact of the presence of informed users on the dynamic assignment on the network. To do so, we provide an analytical study on the Braess paradox where we explore the possibility of improving the assignment of users through the information that is provided to them. The simulation model is cellular automata based and was executed on a multilevel network that includes a Braess paradox in order to validate the analytical results.
### 108. Study an optimal frequency design problem for multimodal network using probit-based user equilibrium assignment
> In this paper, a probit-based multimodal transport assignment model is developed. Three transport modes (railway system, bus system, and automobiles) and their interactions are considered. The walking time to a bus stop or a station also plays an important role in multimodal networks. Thus, walking to a bus stop or to a railway station is included in the model. The factors affecting travelers' route choices considered in this model include actual travel times, discomfort effects on transit systems, expected waiting times, fares, and constants specific to transport modes. A route in the model may be composed of different modes. The paper also deals with the optimal transit frequency design problem. The frequency design problem is formulated as an implicit program in which the objective function of total disutility in the multimodal network is minimized with respect to frequencies of transit lines. The flows on a multimodal network follow a probit-based stochastic user equilibrium assignment. A numerical example is presented.
### 109. Multimodal transit services with heterogeneous travelers
> Public transit systems play a pivotal role in serving the transportation needs of many major cities. In Hong Kong, for example, more than 90% of the 11 million daily trips are provided by public transit services. The planning and design of these services, therefore, are important welfare considerations. The situation is particularly intriguing if these services are to be provided by the private sector whose primary objective is not to ensure welfare gains or an efficient utilization of the road space but to maximize profit. Analyses are of significant interest and potential application to many transit-oriented cities. In metropolitan areas in which multi- or intermodal trips are common, modeling the multimodal route-choice characteristics of heterogeneous travelers and the strategic interactions among the many private firms are important issues. In this study, mode-choice models were integrated in a network of competing transit operators. A novel network structure, designated as the state-augmented multimodal (SAM) network, was developed via a state augmentation approach. With this SAM network, the effect of fare competition and regulations on social welfare as well as on profitability of the companies could be examined. A case study of the ground transportation system connecting the Hong Kong International Airport with the city's downtown was conducted.
### 110. A review of transport market modeling using game-theoretic principles
> Transport markets involve interactions between multiple groups of decision-makers, hence they are good candidates to be analyzed through the prism of game theory. The many models and algorithms published to date tend to reflect different academic disciplines, including operations research, economics and engineering approaches. Models published in the operations research oriented journals often involve large network components in order to provide relatively specific insights, building on Stackelberg, Wardrop and traffic assignment formulations. Game-theoretic models published in economics journals are frequently conceptual with stylized assumptions, such as Cournot, Bertrand and Hotelling, all of which have been applied to transportation markets. We present the more common models and highlight the differences in the equilibria outcomes drawing from the choice of model and beliefs of the players in the market. We discuss the most widely applied algorithms and formulations utilized to solve network-based transport markets. Finally, we review the published literature with real-world applications and discuss potential new areas yet to be explored substantially, including the analysis of multi-modal markets involving both competition and cooperation across transport modes.

### 111. Integration between activity-based demand models and multimodal assignment: Some empirical evidences
> Aiming at supporting decision makers in transport policy choices, transport models used for decades the trip-based approach for travel demand forecasts. This approach, despite suited to peak hours modelling where systematic trips are predominant, suffers the limits of not being related to the sequence of activities usually undertaken in real day-life. Differently, in the Activity Based Models (ABM) the travel demand is explicitly modelled as the result of individuals' involvement in different activities in different times and locations. The use of such models is recommended when complex trip chains connected to the multiple daily activities that characterise today's life have to be taken into account, even if the integration with other sub-models (particularly with the assignment) within the whole transport modelling procedure has to be carefully considered. For this reason, this paper focuses on the integration between ABM and transport assignment by investigating the multimodal demand-supply interaction. Specifically, the consistency between ABM and assignment models is studied proposing a methodology that can be applied to large real size networks. It is based on a multimodal static equilibrium assignment, which is easy-to-use and less time consuming with respect to a Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA), allowing a better estimation of the modal splits between alternative transport modes. Such a model also considers (road) congestion and (transit) crowding phenomena, as well as the multimodal network performances are estimated by taking into account the interaction between different modes sharing the same network facilities. The goodness of the proposed approach is investigated through the convergence analysis of both the entire integration procedure and its individual components (ABM and assignment) for a better transport simulation in urban areas. The application to an urban multimodal network of real-size dimensions (Rome) is presented to show the promising results of this research.
### 112. Surrogate-based simulation optimization approach for day-to-day dynamics model calibration with real data
> This paper investigates the day-to-day dynamics model from the perspective of travelers' actual route choice behaviors, and calibrates and validates the route-based day-to-day dynamics model with the real-world license plate recognition (LPR) data. Due to the highly nonlinear and multimodal response function in the calibration of the optimization problem, traditional gradient-based nonlinear regression algorithms or other analytical optimization approaches are inapplicable to deal with the calibration work. In this paper, a surrogate-based simulation optimization approach is proposed to deal with the expensive-to-evaluate response function in the day-to-day dynamics calibration work, More specifically, the kriging metamodel is adopted to surrogate the optimization function of the calibration process. With this meta-modeling approach, a sound solution can be achieved with only a few sampling points in a comfortably afforded computation burden, thus giving a valid estimation of the parameters in the day-to-day dynamics model. Finally, a case study based on the real-world LPR data is conducted to validate the proposed model and calibration method.
### 113. A new bi-objective model of the urban public transportation hub network design under uncertainty
> This paper presents a new bi-objective multi-modal hub location problem with multiple assignment and capacity considerations for the design of an urban public transportation network under uncertainty. Because of the high construction costs of hub links in an urban public transportation network, it is not economic to create a complete hub network. Moreover, the demand is assumed to be dependent on the utility proposed by each hub. Thus, the elasticity of the demand is considered in this paper. The presented model also has the ability to compute the number of each type of transportation vehicles between every two hubs. The objectives of this model are to maximize the benefits of transportation by establishing hub facilities and to minimize the total transportation time. Since exact values of some parameters are not known in advance, a fuzzy multi-objective programming based approach is proposed to optimally solve small-sized problems. For medium and large-sized problems, a meta-heuristic algorithm, namely multi-objective particle swarm optimization is applied and its performance is compared with results from the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrated the validity of our developed model and approaches. Moreover, an intensive sensitivity analyze study is carried out on a real-case application related to the monorail project of the holy city of Qom.
### 114. Asymmetric problems and stochastic process models of traffic assignment
> There is a spectrum of asymmetric assignment problems to which existing results on uniqueness of equilibrium do not apply. Moreover, multiple equilibria may be seen to exist in a number of simple examples of real-life phenomena, including interactions at priority junctions, responsive traffic signals, multiple user classes, and multi-modal choices. In contrast, recent asymptotic results on the stochastic process approach to traffic assignment establish the existence of a unique, stationary, joint probability distribution of flows under mild conditions, that include problems with multiple equilibria. In studying the simple examples mentioned above, this approach is seen to be a powerful tool in suggesting the relative, asymptotic attractiveness of alternative equilibrium solutions. It is seen that the stationary distribution may have multiple peaks, approximated by the stable equilibria, or a unimodal shape in cases where one of the equilibria dominates. It is seen, however, that the convergence to stationarity may be extremely slow. In Monte Carlo simulations of the process, this gives rise to different types of pseudo-stable behaviour (flows varying in an apparently stable manner, with a mean close to one of the equilibria) for a given problem, and this may prevail for long periods. The starting conditions and random number seed are seen to affect the type of pseudo-stable behaviour over long, but finite, time horizons. The frequency of transitions between these types of behaviour (equivalently, the average sojourn in a locally attractive, pseudo-stable set of states) is seen to be affected by behavioural parameters of the model. Recommendations are given for the application of stochastic process models, in the light of these issues. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd
### 115. A Network-Based Model of Passenger Transfer Flow between Bus and Metro: An Application to the Public Transport System of Beijing
> In a multimodal public transport network, transfers are inevitable. Planning and managing an efficient transfer connection is thus important and requires an understanding of the factors that influence those transfers. Existing studies on predicting passenger transfer flows have mainly used transit assignment models based on route choice, which need extensive computation and underlying behavioral assumptions. Inspired by studies that use network properties to estimate public transport (PT) demand, this paper proposes to use the network properties of a multimodal PT system to explain transfer flows. A statistical model is estimated to identify the relationship between transfer flow and the network properties in a joint bus and metro network. Apart from transfer time, the number of stops, and bus lines, the most important network property we propose in this study is transfer accessibility. Transfer accessibility is a newly defined indicator for the geographic factors contributing to the possibility of transferring at a station, given its position in a multimodal PT network, based on an adapted gravity-based measure. It assumes that transfer accessibility at each station is proportional to the number of reachable points of interest within the network and dependent on a cost function describing the effect of distance. The R-squared of the regression model we propose is 0.69, based on the smart card data, PT network data, and Points of Interest (POIs) data from the city of Beijing, China. This suggests that the model could offer some decision support for PT planners especially when complex network assignment models are too computationally intensive to calibrate and use.
### 116. PACSIM: A new dynamic behavioural model for multimodal traffic assignment
> The present paper provides a brief introduction to PACSIM, a new model for multimodal traffic assignment. This model is distinguished by the introduction of several important features: full dynamism based on an event-driven paradigm, complete modelling of the network of information provided to network users, multilevel network representation, multimodal capabilities and the use of an explicit parametrisable behavioural theory. The paper discusses the main motivations and design concepts and presents an illustrative application of PACSIM to advanced incident warning. Some perspectives are finally outlined.

### 118. A theoretical basis for implementation of a quantitative decision support system - Using bilevel optimisation
> There are very many assessment tools which answer what if ... ? questions, but there are no tools which take the initiative and suggest options for the planner to consider. This paper suggests that there is an urgent need for a decision support tool or system; implemented in software; which does make suggestions to the transportation planner. The paper then outlines a theoretical model which seeks to move non-optimal steady state (traffic, price, green-time) distributions steadily toward locally optimal values taking account of users' responses. The model is a multi-modal equilibrium transportation model with elastic demands. Road prices, prices charged to traverse a route (as with public transport fares) and signal green-times are explicitly included as control variables. The model should permit values of these control variables which meet specified transportation targets to be estimated. The paper expresses the central problem as a bilevel optimisation problem and suggests four different approaches to solving the problem. Results of using a penalty method are given; but the greatest justification is provided for approaches which involve solving a sequence of quadratic or linear subproblems. These methods are perhaps most likely to prove to be efficient.
### 119. Multimodal network design problems
> In this paper we study the Multimodal Network Design Problem (MNDP); this problem arises when a decision maker (e.g. traffic authority) can operate on different transportation modes simultaneously. For this problem we formulate a general multimodal network design model from which descend multimodal and monomodal network design submodels. Possible solution approaches and research perspectives are identified. This paper, therefore, provides a general framework on multimodal and monomodal network design problems and their modeling.
### 120. Multimodal choice set composition - Analysis of reported and generated choice sets
> Multimodal trips are common in today's travel and are expected to become more important. An individual embarking on a multimodal trip faces a number of choice dimensions; such as access and egress mode or modes, origin and destination railway stations, train service types, and transfer stations. For each of these choice dimensions, multiple alternatives are available. To gain insight into the structure and complexity of multimodal trips, a dedicated survey was conducted. Its results include detailed data on chosen trips and reported trip alternatives of 511 multimodal home-bound trips in which the train is the main transport mode. Furthermore, objective choice sets were generated for these respondents and compared with the chosen trips and the reported trip alternatives. It can be concluded that many alternatives are available to travelers, whereas only a limited subset of those alternatives is actually perceived. Even fewer alternatives are actually considered in the choice process. The obtained knowledge of the chosen trips and subjective choice sets can be used to improve choice set generation algorithms and to define strategies for modeling route choice in multimodal networks.
### 121. Validation of a multimodal travel simulator with travel information provision
> This paper presents a computer based travel simulator for collecting data concerning the use of next-generation ATIS and their effects on traveler decision making in a multimodal travel environment. The tool distinguishes itself by presenting a completely abstract multimodal transport network, where knowledge levels are fully controlled for in terms of awareness of mode-route combinations as well as in terms of variability of characteristics of known alternatives. Furthermore, it contains an information service-module that provides a variety of advanced types of travel information, with controlled for levels of reliability. These novel features warrant an extensive validation of the travel simulator. Such a validation is performed, using two datasets (one with revealed data, one with data from an experiment held in the simulator) obtained among 264 participants. Results suggest that the simulator succeeds in collecting useful data on multimodal travel choice making under provision of advanced types of travel information. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

### 122. A GIS-based decision support system for planning urban transportation policies
> A decision support system (DSS) integrated in a geographical information system (GIS) for the analysis and evaluation of different transport policies is presented. The objective of the tool is to assist transport administrators enhance the efficiency of the transportation supply while improving environmental and energy indicators. The DDS works on three levels. The first performs the transport network analysis, the second assesses the energy consumption and pollutant emissions and the third evaluates the several policies selected. Road traffic is simulated using a deterministic, multi-modal traffic assignment model with capacity constraints. The model allows the estimation of traffic flow patterns within each link of the road network starting from the knowledge of the network characteristics and traffic demand. Energy consumption and pollutant emission calculations are based on the methodology developed by the CORINAIR working group. The evaluation of each policy scenario is based on a number of traffic, environmental and energy indicators. A multi-criteria analysis, where decision is based upon judging over appropriate weighted criteria, is adopted. Models are integrated in a GIS environment, which serves as the repository of the data as well as the user interface of the tool. The use of the tool is demonstrated through characteristic case studies on the Greater Athens Area in Greece. Two policy measures, one concerning the extension of the region where half of the private cars are prohibited from entering to the Municipality of Athens and the other the reduction of parking places in the same region by 50% are evaluated.

### 123. Multiobjective Optimization for Multimodal Evacuation
> This paper proposes a multimodal optimization framework that combines vehicular traffic and mass transit for emergency evacuation. The multiobjective approach optimizes the multimodal evacuation framework by investigating three objectives: minimizing in-vehicle travel time, minimizing at-origiin waiting time, and minimizing fleet cost in the case of mass transit evacuation. For auto evacuees, an optimal spatiotemporal evacuation (OSTE) formulation is presented for generating optimal demand scheduling, destination choice, and route choice simultaneously. OSTE implements dynamic traffic assignment techniques coupled with genetic optimization to achieve the objective functions. For transit vehicles, a multiple-depot, time-constrained, pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem (MDTCPD-VRP) is formulated to model the use of public transit shuttle buses during evacuation. MDTCPD-VRP implements constraint programming and local search techniques to achieve the objective function and satisfy constraints. The OSTE and MDTCPD-VRP platforms are integrated in one framework to replicate the impact of congestion caused by traffic on transit vehicle travel times. This paper presents a prototype implementation of the conceptual framework for a hypothetical medium-size network in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The results show that including the waiting time and the in-vehicle travel time in the objective function reduced the network clearance time for auto-evacuees by 40% compared with including only the in-vehicle travel time. For mass transit, when considering fleet cost, an increase of 13% in network clearance time for transit evacuees was observed with a decrease of 12% in fleet size. Mass transit was shown to provide latent transportation capacity that is needed in evacuation situations.
### 124. Integrated Mode Choice and Dynamic Traveler Assignment in Multimodal Transit Networks Mathematical Formulation, Solution Procedure, and Large-Scale Application
> This paper introduces an integrated mode choice-multimodal transit assignment model and solution procedure intended for large-scale urban applications. The cross-nested logit mode choice model assigns travelers to car, transit, or park-and-ride. The dynamic multimodal transit assignment-simulation model determines minimum hyperpaths and assigns and simulates transit and park-and-ride travelers iteratively until the network approaches a state of equilibrium. After a given number of iterations, the updated transit network travel times are fed into the mode choice model and the model reassigns travelers to transit, car, or park-and-ride. The outer feedback loop between the mode choice model and the transit assignment model continues until the mode probabilities for each traveler do not change between iterations. A unique contribution of the method presented in this paper is that it reaches mode choice convergence with the use of disaggregate agents (travelers) instead of aggregate modal flows at the origin-destination level. The integrated model is successfully implemented on the Chicago Transit Agency's bus and train network in Illinois. Different procedures for reaching convergence are tested; the results suggest that a gap-based formulation is more efficient than the method of successive averages.
### 125. Multi-criterion system optimization model for urban multimodal traffic network
> In this paper, computational models of environmental pollution and energy consumption of urban multimodal traffic network are proposed according to pertinent research and a multi-objective programming model is then developed to formulate optimization problem for such a system. Simultaneously, the main factors, such as travel time, pricing and convenience which influence travelers' choice behaviors are all considered and a combined assignment model is proposed to simulate travelers' mode and route choices. A bi-level programming model, in which the multi-objective optimization model is treated as the upper-level problem and the combined assignment model is processed as the lower-level problem, is then presented to solve multi-criterion system optimization problem for urban multimodal traffic network. The solution algorithms of the proposed models are also presented. Finally, the model and its algorithms are illustrated through a simple numerical example.
### 126. Strategies to Improve the Efficiency of a Multimodal Interdependent Transportation System in Disasters
> A multimodal transportation system is the prevalent commuting mode in urban areas and may be comprised of various transportation modes with flexible transfer options, such as automobiles, buses, subway, and other types of rail transit. Examining the efficiency and reliability of such an interdependent system in disasters is quite challenging due to the complexities associated with the dynamic nature of the commuting pattern, formation of choke points, and chaos resulted from the disaster that may affect people's route choice behavior in the face of urgent evacuation. For road traffic many transportation engineers utilize route guidance system as a tool for managing traffic away from the disaster area. With uncertainty in the highway network during a disaster, system efficiency is crucial in disaster management planning. Within a multimodal framework, this paper offers different strategies to improve the transportation system efficiency in various disaster situations when choke points are formed. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the strategies. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
### 127. Multimodal, multiclass stochastic dynamic traffic assignment for evaluating information provision strategies
> A multimodal, multiclass stochastic dynamic traffic assignment model was developed to evaluate pre-trip and enroute travel information provision strategies. Three different information strategies were examined: user optimum [UO], system optimum [SO] and mixed optimum [MO]. These information provision strategies were analyzed based on the levels of traffic congestion and market penetration rate for the information equipment. Only two modes, bus and car, were used for evaluating and calculating the modal split ratio. Several scenarios were analyzed using day-to-day and within day dynamic models. From the results analyzed, it was found that when a traffic manager provides information for drivers using the UO strategy and drivers follow the provided information absolutely, the total travel time may increases over the case with no information. Such worsening occurs when drivers switch their routes and face traffic congestion on the alternative route. This phenomenon is the 'Braess Paradox'.
### 128. Evolution of multimodal final user equilibrium considering public transport network design history
> Analysing the properties of a network equilibrium can help to have a better view about network state, robustness, and the effect of any variation in the network. This study investigated the impacts of network design history on day-to-day multimodal user equilibrium. In particular, we analyze the long-term evolution of the network, including opening new multimodal options and its impacts on the final network equilibrium. First, the analysis focuses on static network loading with different successive configurations. Then, a more realistic setting is studied by simulation. A large-scale multimodal network with the flexible opening over time of three possible transport facilities shows that the final equilibrium is not unique; more importantly, significant differences can be observed in public transportation occupancy, while user equilibrium is enforced in all situations. Some solutions prove to be better from the collective viewpoint (shorter total travel time), thus giving new insight into public transport planning.
### 129. Computational Methods for Calculating Multimodal Multiclass Traffic Network Equilibrium: Simulation Benchmark on a Large-Scale Test Case
> This study reviews existing computational methods to calculate simulation-based dynamic network equilibrium. We consider a trip-based multimodal approach for the dynamic network loading. Mode and path choices are carried out at the same level; therefore, travel times depend on the travel path and the mode attributes of travelers. This study develops a multiclass model with several parameters per class. Two different categories of algorithms (heuristic and metaheuristic) are considered in order to solve the discrete dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) problem. Finally, we analyze the equilibrium in a large-scale multimodal DTA test case (Lyon 6th + Villeurbanne) in order to investigate the performance of different optimization approaches to solve trip-based DTA. The results show that, in a multimodal and heterogeneous setting, the metaheuristic methods provide better solutions than the heuristic methods in terms of optimality and computation time. These improvements are even more significant than in a homogeneous setting.
### 130. Hurried or risk-adverse travelers: who will pay more for multimodal information?
> By enabling the use of multimodal information by travelers, public policy can improve the use of soft travel modes and reduce the negative externalities of car use. However, such an eco-innovative multimodal information platform might only be efficient if travelers are willing to use it and pay for its development and update. To evaluate the relevance of the creation of a multimodal platform in the Plateau de Saclay - an area located 20 km south of Paris, very concerned by congestion - this paper measures workers' willingness to pay (WTP) for such a platform from a survey conducted in this area. A multinomial logit with unobserved heterogeneity is estimated to determine marginal WTP for the services that could potentially be provided by the platform. The respective effects of risk aversion and value of travel time on this marginal WTP are also investigated. Some gender differences in the evaluation of the platform and its trip planning are also apparent: men's WTP increases with their value of travel time and decreases with their risk aversion while women's WTP is mainly influenced by the constraints they may face when commuting (C) 2015 The Authors.

### 131. Temporal validation of a multimodal transit assignment model
> With the increasing demand and range of urban mobility, public transport systems are playing an increasingly important role in providing people with efficient and affordable access to education, employment, markets, and other key services. Public transport planners can predict passenger loads and levels of service by using transit assignment models. Therefore, having a consistent transit assignment model has become an important issue. In addition, estimating the path choice factors, considering that network cost attributes might be non-deterministic, is complicated. In view of these, this paper adapted a transit assignment model, based on the Bayesian Model proposed in the authors' recent study, to validate the results of the model for multimodal transit networks under uncertainty and random variations of path choice parameters. In that model, path choices are represented by a multinomial logit model, and its coefficients are estimated via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. In this paper, the path choice parameters of the model are first calibrated by the individual travel history data in the AM peak period, and then are used to predict the passenger flow on different paths in the PM peak period. Second, based on the percentage error between each posterior estimate and the actual observation from AFC data on the segment level, the path segments are categorized into four groups. Then, by defining the segment attributes, the strengths and weaknesses of the model are analysed for the four groups.
### 132. A dynamic evacuation model for pedestrian-vehicle mixed-flow networks
> In urban emergency evacuation, a potentially large number of evacuees may depend either on transit or other modes, or need to walk a long distance, to access their passenger cars. In the process of approaching the designated pick-up points or parking areas for evacuation, the massive number of pedestrians may cause tremendous burden to vehicles in the roadway network. Responsible agencies often need to contend with congestion incurred by massive vehicles emanating from parking garages, evacuation buses generated from bus stops, and the conflicts between evacuees and vehicles at intersections. Hence, an effective plan for such evacuation needs to concurrently address both the multi-modal traffic route assignment and the optimization of network signal controls for mixed traffic flows. This paper presents an integrated model to produce the optimal distribution of vehicle and pedestrian flows, and the responsive network signal plan for massive mixed pedestrian-vehicle flows within the evacuation zone. The proposed model features its effectiveness in accounting for multiple types of evacuation vehicles, the interdependent relations between pedestrian and vehicle flows via some conversion locations, and the inevitable conflicts between intersection turning vehicle and pedestrian flows. An illustrating example concerning an evacuation around the M&T stadium area has been presented, and the results indicate the promising properties of our proposed model, especially on reflecting the complex interactions between vehicle and pedestrian flows and the favorable use of high-occupancy vehicles for evacuation operations.

### 133. Data-driven stochastic transit assignment modeling using an automatic fare collection system
> In modern urban transit networks, buses and subways are not distinguished as different modes of transportation; this makes it challenging to analyze travel behaviors with multiple modes for the purpose of developing policies and plans. With the introduction of Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) systems, these modes are operated along a complex of links and nodes that constitute a multimodal transit network. Methods for analyzing travel behaviors in mass transit have been developed, but previous approaches fail to adequately reflect travel behaviors and network features (e.g., transfers, mode and route preferences). To overcome such limitations, this research proposes a smart card data-based analytical method with which travel behaviors can be efficiently and accurately examined. AFC systems provide a tremendous amount of data that contain detailed trip information, and using these data reinforces the reliability of the proposed data driven method. The proposed method of analysis involves four core processes: establishing a scheme for how multiple transit modes can be integrated into one multimodal transit network on the basis of information derived from the AFC system, selecting feasible paths, assigning trips using a stochastic approach, and verifying analytical results by comparing them with findings from trip datasets. This method was used to analyze monthly smart card data collected from the AFC system in 2009 in the greater Seoul area. Multimodal transit networks were constructed from 34,852 bus stops and 539 subway stations using smart card data, and in total, 3,614,875 trips were used in the analysis. The final model for stochastic transit assignment was developed using the proposed method, which was verified by comparing actual and assigned trips. The proposed method exhibits high accuracy (83.93%) and a high R-square value (0.981), which supports the strength of the proposed stochastic transit assignment model. The findings reveal new interesting research directions for exploration, such as developing more disaggregated models (e.g., for specific regions, times, and users), considering detailed transfer features (e.g., transferable boundaries, transfer facilities, and transfer times), confirming the method's applicability by testing it in other cities, and incorporating both multimodal transit and road networks into the proposed model.
### 134. Schedule Consistency for Daily Activity Chains in Integrated Activity-Based Dynamic Multimodal Network Assignment
> The dynamic multimodal network assignment problem at the daily schedule level is addressed by integrating an activity-based model and a dynamic traffic assignment tool through a unified framework. The framework achieves this integration while retaining disaggregated individualized information. The problem is formulated as a fixed-point problem, and equilibrium is achieved by minimizing the gap between the expected travel lime, which is used by the activity-based model to generate the travelers' individual and household activity schedules, and their experienced travel times, simulated by the dynamic traffic assignment tool. The schedule adjustment problem for individuals and households is formulated as a linear optimization problem. Two measures-inconsistent-schedule penalty and number of households with unrealistic schedules-are defined to monitor the status of the equilibrium and convergence gap of the integrated system. To ensure convergence of the applied integration, heuristic strategies for selecting individuals for schedule adjustment and path swap are tested in a subarea network of Chicago, Illinois. Selecting individuals for schedule adjustment based on their inconsistent-schedule penalty reduces both defined measures significantly and leads to the convergence of the planned schedule and the experienced (i.e., simulated) schedule.
### 135. Dynamic System Optimal Routing in Multimodal Transit Network
> The system optimal routing problem has been widely studied for road networks, though less considered for public transit systems. Traditional shortest path-based multimodal itinerary guidance systems may deteriorate the system performance when the assigned lines become congested. The dynamic system optimal routing model for multimodal transit system is formulated for that issue. The transit system is represented by a multilevel graph to explicitly simulate passenger flow and transit system operations. A solution algorithm based on the cross entropy method is proposed, and its performance is compared with the method of successive averages in static and dynamic cases. A numerical study of a simple multimodal transit network provides the basis for comparing system optimal routing and user optimal routing under different congestion levels.
### 136. COMBINED MODAL SPLIT AND ASSIGNMENT MODEL FOR THE MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION NETWORK OF THE ECONOMIC CIRCLE IN CHINA
> Economic circles have been formed and developing in China. An economic circle consists of more than one closely adjoining central cities and their influence zones. It is always the major engine for the development of one country's economy and even for the world economy. A combined modal split and assignment model with deterministic travel demand is proposed for modelling passengers' choices of intercity bus and train which are two main competing modes in the multimodal transportation network of the economic circle. The generalized travel cost model of highway and railway are used incorporating travel time, ticket fare and passenger's discomfort. On the highway network, the interactions of private vehicles and intercity buses are asymmetric. Thus, a variational inequality formulation is proposed to describe the combined model. The streamlined diagonalization algorithm is presented to solve the combined model. The multimodal transportation network based on Yangtze River Delta economic circle is presented to illustrate the proposed method. The results show the efficiency of the proposed model.
### 137. Integrated simulation-based dynamic traffic and transit assignment model for large-scale network
> Although the traffic and transit assignment processes are intertwined, the interactions between them are usually ignored in practice, especially for large-scale networks. In this paper, we build a simulation-based traffic and transit assignment model that preserves the interactions between the two assignment processes for the large-scale network of the Greater Toronto Area during the morning peak. This traffic assignment model is dynamic, user-equilibrium seeking, and includes surface transit routes. It utilizes the congested travel times, determined by the dynamic traffic assignment, rather than using predefined timetables. Unlike the static transit assignment models, the proposed transit model distinguishes between different intervals within the morning peak by using the accurate demand, transit schedule, and time-based road level-of-service. The traffic and transit assignment models are calibrated against actual field observations. The resulting dynamic model is suitable for testing different demand management strategies that impose dynamic changes on multiple modes simultaneously.
### 138. Estimation of origin-destination matrices for a multimodal public transit network
> This paper presents a procedure for the estimation of origin-destination (O-D) matrices for a multimodal public transit network. The system consists of a number of favored public transit modes that are obtained from a modal split process in a traditional four-step transportation model. The demand of each favored mode is assigned to the multimodal network, which is comprised of a set of connected links of different public transit modes. An entropy maximization procedure is proposed to simultaneously estimate the O-D demand matrices of all favored modes, which are consistent with target data sets such as the boarding counts and line segment flows that are observed directly in the network. A case study of the Hong Kong multimodal transit network is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
### 139. Impact analysis of cordon-based congestion pricing on mode-split for a bimodal transportation network
> This paper investigates the impact of cordon-based congestion pricing scheme on the mode-split of a bimodal transportation network with auto and rail travel modes. For any given toll-charge pattern, its impact on the mode-split can be estimated by solving a combined mode-split and traffic-assignment problem. Using a binary logit model for the mode-split, the combined problem is converted into a traffic-assignment problem with elastic demand. Probit-based stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) principle is adopted for this traffic-assignment problem, and a continuously distributed value of time (VOT) is assumed to convert the toll charges and transit fares into time-units. This combined mode-split and traffic-assignment problem is then formulated as a fixed-point model, which can be solved by a convergent Cost Averaging method. The combined mode-split and traffic-assignment problem is then used to analyze a multimodal toll design problem for cordon-based congestion pricing scheme, with the aim of increasing the mode-share of public transport system to a targeted level. Taking the fixed-point model as a constraint, the multimodal toll design problem is thus formulated as a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) model. A genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to solve this MPEC model, which is then numerical validated by a network example. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 140. A simulation-optimization approach to design efficient systems of bike-sharing
> This article presents a methodology to simultaneously modelize private car and public bicycle transport modes, considering their interactions through the modeling of the modal split and the assignment of each mode's trips to the network. Then the model is used to optimize the location of docking stations in a public sharing bicycle system, to achieve a transport system as efficient and sustainable as economically and socially possible. To model the car-bike system, it was necessary to perform a user behavior analysis, emphasizing the characterization of the potential bicycle user. Our objectives were: to discern which variables does the user take into account to choose, in an urban environment, between public bicycle and car; and to modelize bicycle users' route choice. The proposed methodology is divided into three parts. In the first one, a transport network was created, over which car and bicycle users can be simulated at the same time. The second part is a type of combined modal split-assignment model, with its input coming from a global matrix (car and bicycle trips). A Multinomial Logit model for modal split and network assignment models will follow an iterative process to provide the final OD matrices and service variables for each mode of transport. After the definition and validation of the multimodal model, the third part, an optimization model, has been developed, based on bi-level mathematical programming. The objective is to optimize the location of a system of public bicycle docking stations. A combination of the different optimization criteria and problem reduction strategies has been applied to the real scenario of Santander city (Spain). It has been possible to perform a comparative analysis of the current situation, versus the model's proposal, getting results helpful to the relevant decision-making entities.

### 141. Network pricing optimization in multi-user and multimodal context with elastic demand
> Network Pricing Optimization (NPO) is formulated first as a Network Design Problem (NDP) where the design variables are tolls, the objective function is the Social Surplus and the equilibrium constraint is any current multi-user multimodal stochastic traffic assignment model with elastic demand up to trip generation and asymmetric arc cost function Jacobian. NPO is then formulated also as an Efficient Allocation Problem (EAP), where an optimal flow pattern, the System Optimum (SO), is sought and tolls are consistently determined. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the solutions to both problems are stated, showing the validity of the marginal pricing principle in the context considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

### 142. The role of coordination costs in mode choice decisions: A case study of German cities
> In times of accelerating urbanization and environmental pollution, mode choice decisions (MCD) are a critical parameter in a city's appearance and its environmental impacts. Simultaneously, the emerging smartphone multimodal traveller information systems (SMTIS) simplifies the usage of multimodal trips and, therefore, enhance the options in MCD. Current MCD models, in addition to considering classic parameters like travel time and cost, also consider socioeconomic variables and latent variables, such as modal preferences or mode-specific characteristics. However, from the users' perspective, one main influence is currently still not sufficiently considered in these models: Coordination costs for planning the trip, such as looking-up time tables for public transport. Consequently, we introduced this variable in a multinomial logit model and made a representative survey in Germany for measuring the coordination effort and evaluating our model. Our results support our hypothesis that coordination costs have a significant impact on MCD. We therefore conclude that further developments in information systems together with supporting policies may influence the MCD and, hence, lead to more sustainable cities in the future.
### 143. Multimodal Connections between Dockless Bikesharing and Ride-Hailing: An Empirical Study in New York City
> Motivated by the meteoric rise in the adoption of both ride-hailing services (DiDi, Uber, Lyft, etc.) and dockless bikesharing services (Ofo, Mobike, LimeBike, etc.), we propose a multimodal system where passengers ride a dockless bikeshare to/from hubs where they switch modes to/from a carpool. The proposed mutlimodal system is a generalization of the existing Uber ExpressPool service. The goal of this paper is to test empirically the feasibility of the proposed multimodal system. We accomplish this goal with the aid of time-stamped taxi origin/destination data from New York City. The analysis has two steps: network design and trip assignment. First, we identify 17 carpool hub locations with a coverage of 1 km to capture all taxi trip demand within Manhattan during peak hours. After designing the network, we then assign trips to carpools, within each hub, that have similar trip start times and destinations. We formulate the assignment problem as an offline matching algorithm on a bipartite graph. We found that over 80 percent of all trips can be assigned to carpools at almost all hubs. Compared to a single-modal system, the multimodal system served the same number of passengers with 40 percent fewer taxis. We found the matching rate to be consistent for every month in 2015. These results provide initial evidence that multimodal connections between ride-hailing and dockless bikesharing are feasible, reduces passenger trip times, and decreases road congestion.
### 144. Multimodal Evacuation Simulation and Scenario Analysis in Dense Urban Area
> Simulation is an effective tool for estimating evacuation times, identifying system bottlenecks, and evaluating traffic management strategies under a variety of operational and behavioral assumptions. The development of a multimodal simulation model for modeling evacuation activities in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is presented. The model applied a dynamic sequential assignment method to simulate the movement and interactions of pedestrians, private vehicles, and buses while considering the variation of evacuation demand and network conditions during evacuation operations. The model was used to perform scenario analysis and provide inputs to update current evacuation plans. This study shares the experience and findings from the Philadelphia study in modeling multimodal evacuations in dense urban areas.
### 145. Dynamic Assignment-Simulation Methodology for Multimodal Urban Transit Networks
> This paper presents an integrated transit assignment-simulation tool. Finding least cost hyperpaths in a large-scale network and assigning travelers onto these paths are computationally challenging problems. Moreover, modeling the spatial and temporal complexities in a transit network that result from the discontinuities in transit events, such as missing a connection and not receiving a seat, exacerbates the issue of capturing realism. These challenges are overcome by (a) using a least cost hyperpath algorithm that captures the multimodal, multipattern, time-, and approach-dependent features of a transit network to provide realistic optimal strategies; (b) using a gap-based assignment approach to reach fast convergence; and (c) developing a multiagent particle simulation platform that is able to capture the heterogeneities and the discontinuities in travel. The platform was tested on the Chicago Transit Authority network of 14,000 nodes and 64,000 links; 1.25 million travelers were assigned and simulated, along with 21,000 transit vehicles. The assigmnent-simulation framework can be used as a network evaluation tool to assist decision making at the strategic and operational levels.
### 146. Optimizing route choice in multimodal transportation networks
> Advanced traveler information systems provide travelers with pre-trip and en route travel information necessary to improve the trip decision making process based on various criteria (e. g., avoiding the negative impacts of traffic congestion, selecting specific travel modes, etc.). This study investigates an adaptive routing methodology for multimodal transportation networks. To integrate transit networks, the model takes into account both the predefined timetables of public transportation services and the variability of travel times. A graph theory based methodology is proposed to capture travel behavior within a multimodal network. The study advances a routing algorithm based on Markov decision processes. Special network modeling elements were defined to allow the developed algorithm to select the most efficient transportation mode at each junction along a given route. The proposed methodology is applied to a small real-world network located in the central business district area of Montreal, Quebec. The network includes bus, subway, and bicycle transportation facilities. The simulations were run under the assumption that users do not use private vehicles to travel between arbitrary selected origin and destination points. The developed routing algorithm was applied to several simulation scenarios. The results identified what is the most efficient combination of transportation modes that the travelers have to use given certain traffic and transit service conditions. Larger and more complex networks of motorized and non-motorized modes with stochastic properties will be investigated in subsequent work.
### 147. A Model to Simulate Multimodality in a Mesoscopic Dynamic Network Loading Framework
> A dynamic network loading (DNL) model using a mesoscopic approach is proposed to simulate a multimodal transport network considering en-route change of the transport modes. The classic mesoscopic approach, where packets of users belonging to the same mode move following a path, is modified to take into account multiple modes interacting with each other, simultaneously and on the same multimodal network. In particular, to simulate modal change, functional aspects of multimodal arcs have been developed; those arcs are properly located on the network where modal change occurs and users are packed (or unpacked) in a new modal resource that moves up to destination or to another multimodal arc. A test on a simple network reproducing a real situation is performed in order to show model peculiarities; some indicators, used to describe performances of the considered transport system, are shown.
### 148. Advanced pricing and rationing policies for large scale multimodal networks
> The applying of simplified schemes, such as cordon pricing, as second-best solution to the toll network design problem is investigated here in the context of multiclass traffic assignment on multimodal networks. To this end a suitable equilibrium model has been developed, together with an efficient algorithm capable of simulating large scale networks in quite reasonable computer time. This model implements the theoretical framework proposed in a previous work on the toll optimization problem, where the validity of marginal cost pricing for the context at hand is stated. Application of the model to the real case of Rome shows us, not only that on multimodal networks a relevant share (up to 20%) of the maximum improvements in terms of social welfare achievable with marginal cost pricing can in fact be obtained through cordon pricing, but also that in practical terms rationing is a valid alternative to pricing, thus getting around some of the relevant questions (theoretical, technical, social) the latter raises. As a result we propose a practical method to analyze advanced pricing and rationing policies differentiated for user categories, which enables us to compare alternative operative solutions with an upper bound on social welfare based on a solid theoretical background.

### 149. A mixed-equilibrium model of individual and household activity-travel choices in multimodal transportation networks
> This paper develops a novel household-oriented activity-based mixed-equilibrium model for estimating individual and household activity-travel choices in multimodal transportation networks with interactions between private car and public transit modes. In the novel model, household members with heterogeneous errors of perception on the time-dependent utility of different activity types make daily joint/solo activity-travel choices in a mixed-equilibrium manner, which maximizes either perceived household utility or perceived individual utility. A logit-based stochastic choice model is developed to capture the mixed equilibrium with heterogeneous errors of perception and used to predict the choices of alternative joint activity-travel paths (JATPs) on a supernetwork platform. Based on this stochastic JATP choice model, the mixed-equilibrium model is formulated as an equivalent variational inequality (VI) problem and solved using a modified diagonalization method. This converts the time-dependent activity-travel scheduling problem into an equivalent static traffic assignment problem on JATPs. The conditions required for the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the equivalent VI problem in terms of a JATP flow pattern are also identified. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the model's merits and its applications for examining the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
### 150. Combination of mobile agent and evolutionary algorithm to optimize the client transport services
> This paper presents a migration strategy for a set of mobile agents (MAs) in order to satisfy customers' requests in a transport network, through a multimodal information system. In this context, we propose an optimization solution which operates on two levels. The first one aims to constitute a set of MAs building their routes, called Workplans. At this level, Workplans must incorporate all nodes, representing information providers in the multimodal network, in order to explore it completely. Thanks to an evolutionary approach, the second level must optimize nodes selection in order to increase the number of satisfied users. The assignment of network nodes to the required services must be followed by a Workplan update procedure in order to deduce final routes paths. Finally, simulation results are mentioned to invoke the different steps of our adopted approach.
### 151. Adaptive Park-and-ride Choice on Time-dependent Stochastic Multimodal Transportation Network
> In transportation networks with stochastic and dynamic travel times, park-and-ride decisions are often made adaptively considering the realized state of traffic. That is, users continue driving towards their destination if the congestion level is low, but may consider taking transit when the congestion level is high. This adaptive behavior determines whether and where people park-and-ride. We propose to use a Markov decision process to model the problem of commuters' adaptive park-and-ride choice behavior in a transportation network with time-dependent and stochastic link travel times. The model evaluates a routing policy by minimizing the expected cost of travel that leverages the online information about the travel time on outgoing links in making park-and-ride decisions. We provide a case study of park-and-ride facilities located on freeway I-394 in Twin Cities, Minnesota. The results show a significant improvement in the travel time by the use of park-and-ride during congested conditions. It also reveals the time of departure, the state of the traffic, and the location from where park-and-ride becomes an attractive option to the commuters. Finally, we show the benefit of using online routing in comparison to an offline routing algorithm.
### 152. Evaluating the Capacity Coordination in the Urban Multimodal Transport Network
> The urban multimodal transport network is composed of multiple layers of networks; thus, coordinating the capacity equilibrium among different sub-transport networks plays a crucial role to keep the entire network running efficiently. To quantify and evaluate the passenger flow distribution in an urban multimodal transport network, this research proposes a method to evaluate the capacity coordination in an urban multimodal transport network on the basis of assignment results calculated by the Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE) model considering the link and path impedance of different sub-transport networks. It suggests evaluation functions for the indicator level of service (LOS) of the multimodal transport network, Gini coefficient of transport network, and mode share of transport modes, and it shows how the functions were estimated. Then, it reports on results with the evaluation scheme collected in a multimodal example application for roadway network, transit networks (bus transit network and urban rail transit network), and connection network. The evaluation results under different assumed origin-destination (OD) demand show the coordination degree and can be used to recognize shortcomings of the network. Moreover, the OD demand interval of real network with good coordination can be deduced, which can also help transport planners to find the optimal strategy.
### 153. Modeling the competitiveness of a bike-sharing system using bicycle GPS and transit smartcard data
> Competitiveness is an important factor for the sustainable mobility of an integrated multimodal system. In this study, we explore and answer the question concerning what makes bike-sharing trips more competitive than bus trips. The empirical analysis is conducted using transit smartcard and bike-sharing GPS data collected in Seoul, and logistic regression models were developed to understand the factors contributing to the bike-sharing being more competitive than buses. The findings demonstrate that bike-sharing is not only a complementary mode but could also be competing with buses at certain extents. The results indicate that bike-sharing trips can be more competitive than bus trips with longer detours or when the speed of the bus is reduced, such as peak-time periods and short trips. Travel time of bike-sharing is more reliable than bus's during peak times, while the bike lanes contribute to keeping bike-sharing more competitive even during off-peak times.
### 154. Analysis of multimodal two-dimensional urban system equilibrium for cordon toll pricing and bus service design
> This paper presents a multimodal urban system equilibrium model to address cordon toll pricing and bus service design issues in a two-dimensional monocentric city. Commuters are assumed to travel by auto or bus from their home locations to their workplace located in the city center through a ring-radial routing system. Auto users must pay tolls when passing through the cordons installed on the radial major roads. The multimodal two-dimensional urban system equilibrium is first formulated and its properties are analytically explored. A social welfare maximization model that simultaneously determines the optimal cordon toll location, toll level, bus service frequency and fare on each radial major road is then proposed. The effects of different tolling schemes (uniform and differential cordon-based, first-best, and no toll) on the multimodal urban system are also examined and compared. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

### 155. Joint design of multimodal transit networks and shared autonomous mobility fleets
> Providing quality transit service to travelers in low-density areas, particularly travelers without personal vehicles, is a constant challenge for transit agencies. The advent of fully-autonomous vehicles (AVs) and their inclusion in mobility service fleets may allow transit agencies to offer better service and/or reduce their own capital and operational costs. This study focuses on the problem of allocating resources between transit patterns and operating (or subsidizing) shared-use AV mobility services (SAMSs) in a large metropolitan area. To address this question, a joint transit network redesign and SAMS fleet size determination problem (JTNR-SFSDP) is introduced, and a bi-level mathematical programming formulation and solution approach are presented. The upper-level problem modifies a transit network frequency setting problem (TNFSP) formulation via incorporating SAMS fleet size as a decision variable and allowing the removal of bus routes. The lower-level problem consists of a dynamic combined mode choice-traveler assignment problem (DCMC-TAP) formulation. The heuristic solution procedure involves solving the upper-level problem using a nonlinear programming solver and solving the lower-level problem using an iterative agent-based assignment-simulation approach. To illustrate the effectiveness of the modeling framework, this study uses traveler demand from Chicago along with the regions existing multimodal transit network. The computational results indicate significant traveler benefits, in terms of improved average traveler wait times, associated with optimizing the joint design of multimodal transit networks and SAMS fleets compared with the initial transit network design.
### 156. Pareto-improving congestion pricing on multimodal transportation networks
> This paper determines a Pareto-improving pricing scheme for alleviating congestion in a multimodal transportation network that includes, e.g., transit services, high-occupancy/toll and general-purpose lanes. In this setting, a pricing scheme refers to a strategy for tolling roads and highways as well as adjusting fares on various transit lines. In addition, such a scheme is Pareto-improving if it maximizes the social benefit without increasing travel-related expense of stakeholders that include individual road users, transit passengers, transit operators, transportation authorities, etc. The user equilibrium and system optimum problem in the multimodal transportation network are discussed along with a model for determining Pareto-improving tolls. The latter is formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate results from various models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

### 157. Modeling Evacuation of a Transport System: Application of a Multimodal Mesoscopic Dynamic Traffic Assignment Model
> In this paper, the analysis of a transportation system under emergency conditions due to hazardous events is considered. To assess the effects on the analyzed transport network, an extension to a mesoscopic dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model was developed to determine quantitative indicators for estimating the exposure component of the total risk incurred by the transport networks in an area. In particular, a new version that is able to allow for multimodal networks and to consider network reliability was introduced. To give a practical example of the proposed model, it has been applied to two real networks, studying evacuation in the hypothesis that in the event of a calamity the population in the area follows the instructions proposed by the municipal civil protection plan. The work shows how adequate quantitative methodologies based on a dynamic approach can be a useful tool to support the process of evacuation planning at several scales.
### 158. Joint Frequency-Setting and Pricing Optimization on Multimodal Transit Networks at Scale
> Modern public transportation systems are increasingly complex: they are operated on a large scale, must support booming urban populations, and run under tight budget constraints. Additionally, passengers are able to make choices between a variety of commuting options. We develop formulations for minimizing system wait time in multimodal networks, while accounting for operator budget constraints, capacity constraints, and passenger preferences. Furthermore, our algorithms run to near optimality in minutes for city-sized networks. We demonstrate the benefit of setting schedule frequencies and prices jointly through case studies on real data from Boston and Tokyo. To our knowledge, ours is the first paper that addresses joint frequency-setting and pricing optimization for public transit networks and at scale.
### 159. MODELING SPATIAL EQUILIBRIUM TRAVEL PATTERN WITH MULTIMODAL CHOICES - A LINEAR COMPLEMENTARITY SYSTEM APPROACH
> This paper studies the modeling of spatial equilibrium travel pattern with multimodal choices in a model city with a competitive railway/highway system. Commuters choose either the railway or highway for traveling from their home to city center. Flow dependent travel time on highway and crowding cost of rail transit services are considered. A linear complementarity system is proposed to characterize the commuters' modal choices and spatial equilibrium pattern of trip assignment in the city with given continuous distribution of home locations. The formulated linear complementarity problem is recast into a mixed integer linear programming problem to be solved.
### 160. Modelling Rail-Based Park and Ride with Environmental Constraints in a Multimodal Transport Network
> Environmental sustainability is a significant aspect in the sustainable development of modern urban cities, especially in the road transport system. As traffic demands increase, public transport requires more promotion to accommodate the increasing travel demands while maintaining the environmental quality. Public transport, however, is less attractive in vast suburb areas mainly due to its longer travel distance and waiting time. Therefore, this paper proposes a rail-based Park-and-Ride (RPR) scheme to promote public transport in the multimodal transport network. To remedy the heterogeneous distribution of vehicle pollutants in the network, regulations in environmental sensitive districts are required and studied in this paper. To quantitatively evaluate and analyse this joint RPR and environmental regulation strategy in multimodal transport systems, this paper develops an environmental constrained combined modal split and traffic assignment (EC-CMSTA) model. The proposed formulation adopts the concept of fix-point to reformulate the nonlinear complementarity conditions associated with the combined modal split and user equilibrium conditions, which is subsequently incorporated into a VI formulated nonlinear complementarity conditions associated with environmental constraints. The proposed VI formulation can handle a general constraint structure, which enhances the modelling adaptability and flexibility. The strictly monotone and Lipschitz continuity properties of this model are rigorously proved, giving rise to efficient algorithms for the model. A customized projection based self-adaptive gradient projection (SAGP) algorithm is then developed. Numerical studies demonstrate that the EC-MSTA model could enhance the behavioural modelling of network users' travel decisions and assist in quantitatively evaluating the effectiveness of RPR schemes and environmental regulations.
### 161. Personalized and Situation-Aware Multimodal Route Recommendations: The FAVOUR Algorithm
> Route choice in multimodal networks shows a considerable variation between different individuals and the current situational context. Personalization and situation awareness of recommendation algorithms are already common in many areas, e.g., online retail. However, most online routing applications still provide shortest distance or shortest travel-time routes only, neglecting individual preferences, as well as the current situation. Both aspects are of particular importance in a multimodal setting as attractivity of some transportation modes, such as biking, which crucially depend on personal characteristics and exogenous factors, such as the weather. As an alternative, this paper introduces the FAVourite rOUte Recommendation (FAVOUR) approach to provide personalized, situation-aware route proposals based on three steps: first, at the initialization stage, the user provides limited information (home location, work place, mobility options, sociodemographics) used to select one out of a small number of initial profiles. Second, based on this information, a stated preference survey is designed in order to sharpen the profile. In this step, a mass preference prior (MPP) is used to encode the prior knowledge on preferences from the class identified in step one. Third, subsequently, the profile is continuously updated during usage of the routing services. The last two steps use Bayesian learning techniques in order to incorporate information from all contributing individuals. The FAVOUR approach is presented in detail and tested on a small number of survey participants. The experimental results on this real-world dataset show that FAVOUR generates better quality recommendations w.r.t. alternative learning algorithms from the literature. In particular, the definition of the MPP for initialization of step two is shown to provide better predictions than a number of alternatives from the literature.
### 162. Determining structural route components from GPS traces
> Analysis of GPS traces shows that people often do not use the least cost path through the transportation network while making trips. This leads to the question which structural path characteristics can be used to construct realistic route choice sets for use in traffic simulation models. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that, for utilitarian trips, the route between origin and destination consists of a small number of concatenated least cost paths. The hypothesis is verified by analyzing routes extracted from large sets of recorded GPS traces which constitute revealed preference information. Trips have been extracted from the traces and for each trip the path in the transportation network is determined by map matching. This is followed by a path decomposition phase for which the algorithm constitutes the first contribution of this paper. There are multiple ways to split a given path in a directed graph into a minimal number of subpaths of minimal cost By calculating two specific path splittings, it is possible to identify subsets of the vertices (splitVertexSuites) that can be used to generate every possible minimum path splitting by taking one vertex from each such subset As a second contribution, we show how the extracted information is used in microscopic travel simulation. The distribution for the size of the minimum decomposition, extracted from the GPS traces, can be used in constrained enumeration methods for route choice set generation. The sets of vertices that can act as boundary vertices separating consecutive route parts contain way points (landmarks) having a particular meaning to their user. The paper explains the theoretical aspects of route splitting as well as the process to extract splitVertexSuites from big data. It reports statistical distributions extracted from sets of GPS traces for both multimodal person movements and unimodal car trips. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 163. Gap-based transit assignment algorithm with vehicle capacity constraints: Simulation-based implementation and large-scale application
> This paper presents a gap-based solution method for the time-dependent transit assignment problem with vehicle capacity constraints. A two-level, simulation-based methodology is proposed, which finds the least cost hyperpaths at the upper level and performs the assignment of transit travelers on the hyperpaths at the lower level. The detailed simulation of travelers and vehicles at the lower level allows modelers to capture transit network complexities such as transfers/missed connections, receiving a seat/standing and boarding/being rejected to board. This 'hard' implementation of vehicle capacity constraints at the lower level is aggregated into 'soft constraints' at the upper level for the least cost hyperpath calculation. Using a gap-based assignment procedure, user equilibrium is reached on large-scale networks in a computationally efficient manner. The algorithm is tested on the large-scale Chicago Transit Authority network. The gap-based approach outperforms the commonly used method of successive averages approach in terms of rate of convergence and quality of results. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses with respect to network parameters illustrate the robustness of the proposed two-level solution procedure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 164. Comparison of Agent-Based Transit Assignment Procedure with Conventional Approaches Toronto, Canada, Transit Network and Microsimulation Learning-Based Approach to Transit Assignment
> The public transportation system, a key part of a multimodal transportation network, has been widely viewed as an efficient way to reduce road congestion and pollution. Public transportation planners use transit assignment models to forecast travel demand and service performance. As technologies evolve and smart transit systems become more prevalent, it is important that assignment models adapt to new policies, such as traveler information provision. This paper investigates three transit assignment tools that represent three approaches to modeling transit trip distribution over a network of fixed routes. These tools are the EMME/2 Transit Assignment Module (Module 535), commonly used by planners; Toronto, Canada, Transit Commission's transit assignment tool, MADITUC; and the newly developed Microsimulation Learning-based Approach to Transit Assignment (MILATRAS). These approaches range from aggregate, strategy-based frameworks to fully disaggregate microscopic platforms. MILATRAS presents a stochastic process approach (i.e., nonequilibrium based) for modeling within-day and day-to-day variations in the transit assignment process in which aggregate travel patterns can be extracted from individual choices. Although MILATRAS presents a different standpoint for analysis in comparison with equilibrium-based models, it still gives the steady state run loads. MILATRAS performs comparatively well with EMME/2 and MADITUC. In addition, MILATRAS presents a policy-sensitive platform for modeling the effects of smart transit system policies and technologies on passengers' travel behavior (i.e., trip choices) and transit service performance.
### 165. Multimodal traffic assignment with traffic emission effects
> Traffic emissions are one of the most serious issues that affect urban sustainable development. Due to the heavy pollution from cars, public transport, including electric bicycles, has been regaining its proper position. A multimodal traffic equilibrium model with emission effects (MTEEE) is presented that considers energy use per person and pollutant emissions. MTEEE is based on a general traffic equilibrium model which jointly reduces congestion and emissions in a multimodal transportation network. Aiming for control of the total amount of carbon dioxide and limiting the link concentration of carbon dioxide, the model is expressed as a mathematical programming problem by combining the concept of environmental capacity with traffic capacity as constraints. The proposed MTEEE model is solved by a particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. Two experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the convergence properties of the PSO algorithm.
### 166. Continuum modeling of park-and-ride services considering travel time reliability and heterogeneous commuters - A linear complementarity system approach
> This paper studies the modeling of multimodal choice in a highway/railway system with continuum park-and-ride services along a corridor. Commuter heterogeneity and travel time uncertainty with correlation are considered, while both auto and rail transit are subject to congestion effects. Eventually, the equilibrium multimodal choice is modeled into a linear complementarity system and appropriate solution method is proposed to obtain the spatial equilibrium pattern along the corridor. Computational experiments are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed formulation and potential applications, such as optimization of park-and-ride facilities, development of land use policies to integrate urban development and transportation planning.

### 167. Simultaneous optimization of fuel surcharges and transit service runs in a multimodal transport network: a time-dependent activity-based approach
> This paper addresses the simultaneous optimization problem of fuel surcharges and transit service runs for energy sustainability of multimodal transport network using a time-dependent activity-based approach. To model commuters' choices of trip chain, travel mode, departure time, route, and activity timing and duration over the times of a day, a time-dependent activity and multimodal travel choice equilibrium problem is first addressed and formulated as an equivalent variational inequality (VI) problem. A new model for optimizing the fuel surcharges and transit vehicle runs is proposed to maximize the total social net benefit of the multimodal transport system. The proposed model explicitly considers the interaction between the fuel surcharges and transit service runs and the commuters' activity-travel scheduling behavior. A heuristic solution algorithm is then developed to solve the proposed model. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the application of the proposed model with various sensitivity tests. Insightful findings are presented with particularly the effects of the fuel surcharges and transit service improvement on the performance of the multimodal transport system in terms of the modal split, fuel consumption, and total social net benefit.
### 168. Dynamic Multimodal Freight Routing Using a Co-Simulation Optimization Approach
> The complexity and dynamics of multimodal freight transportation networks make the optimum routing of freight demand a challenging task. Route decision-making in a dynamical and complex urban multimodal transportation environment aims to minimize a certain objective cost relying on the accurate prediction of the traffic network states and the estimation of the route costs that are not readily available. The purpose of this paper is to develop a methodology to be used by a central coordinator who generates individual routing decisions for shippers by minimizing overall cost, assuming that all participating shippers send their demands to this central coordinator. We propose, analyze, and evaluate a multimodal freight routing system with hard vehicle availability and capacity constraints based on a hierarchical Co-Simulation Optimization (COSMO) approach. The COSMO approach consists of a simulation layer that provides traffic state predictions and cost estimations to an upper optimization layer that incorporates a load balancing methodology to speed up the convergence of the optimization algorithm. A simulation test bed consisting of a road traffic simulation and a rail simulation model for the Los Angeles/Long Beach Ports regional area is developed and is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.
### 169. A stochastic multimodal reliable network design problem under adverse weather conditions
> This paper formulates a network design problem (NDP) for finding the optimal public transport service frequencies and link capacity expansions in a multimodal network with consideration of impacts from adverse weather conditions. The proposed NDP aims to minimize the sum of expected total travel time, operational cost of transit services, and construction cost of link capacity expansions under an acceptable level of variance of total travel time. Auto, transit, bus, and walking modes are considered in the multimodal network model for finding the equilibrium flows and travel times. In the proposed network model, demands are assumed to follow Poisson distribution, and weather-dependent link travel time functions are adopted. A probit-based stochastic user equilibrium, which is based on the perceived expected travel disutility, is used to determine the multimodal route of the travelers. This model also considers the strategic behavior of the public transport travelers in choosing their routes, that is, common-line network. Based on the stochastic multimodal model, the mean and variance of total travel time are analytical estimated for setting up the NDP. A sensitivity-based solution algorithm is proposed for solving the NDP, and two numerical examples are adopted to demonstrate the characteristics of the proposed model.

### 170. Modeling overlap in multimodal route choice by including trip part-specific path size factors
> Overlap in route choice is a. well-known problem in travel analysis. Because of overlap, alternatives are no longer independent (statistical effect), whereas little is unknown about how overlap may influence travelers' choice behavior. In this paper, route overlap is dealt with by considering multiple path size factors. Instead of a single path size factor for a complete route (called the basic path size factor), separate path size factors for subroutes are proposed to account for differences in valuation of the overlap between them. Three possible specifications of subroute path size factors are considered. To study the impact of separate path size factors for subroutes, path size logit models, including subroute path size factors, are analyzed and compared with estimation results obtained with multinomial logit, generalized nested logit, and basic path size logit models. It appears that including separate path size factors for subroutes significantly improves modeling performance. Furthermore, travelers appear to value overlap differently depending on when the overlap occurs during the trip. Overlap in the home end and the activity end of the trip are valued negatively, whereas overlap in the train line-haul part is valued positively, improving the trip's attractiveness. The similarity in changes in values for all parameter estimates indicates that the new path size specifications capture additional behavioral effects. The best specification of the subroute-specific path size factor is based on the length of the full route and the total number of full routes that share the overlapping legs.
### 171. A Simulation-Based Dynamic Intermodal Network Equilibrium Algorithm
> This paper introduces a Variational Inequality ( VI) formulation for the time-dependent combined mode split and traffic assignment problem. Travel costs are represented by generalized cost functions and mode choices are deterministically obtained based on assignment to intermodal least cost paths without accounting for possible randomness in travelers' choices. The intermodal user equilibrium (IUE) is estimated using an inner approximation (IA) algorithm that results in a nonlinear program with linear constraints. The algorithm converges assuming continuous and monotonic path travel cost functions. The paths on multimodal networks are computed with an intermodal optimum path algorithm; a cell transmission-based simulator, enhanced to account for both automobile and transit vehicles, is used to estimate the path travel costs. A heuristic search approach is proposed and implemented in the VISTA simulation-based framework. Computational results are presented on example networks to test convergence and equilibrium.
### 172. To switch travel mode or not? Impact of Smartphone delivered high-quality multimodal information
> Travellers' mode switch behaviour with the presence of high-quality Smartphone delivered multimodal information (SMMI) seems to have rarely been addressed. This study investigated commuters' en-trip mode decision about switching from 'auto' to 'park-and-ride' (P + R) under high-quality SMMI that provides travel time for both modes, delay for auto, cause of delay, P + R cost and comfort level of rail transit. It is based on a stated preference survey of Shanghai travellers. A binary logit model was developed to identify contributing factors that affect mode switching decisions. Results showed that SMMI can significantly influence mode choice and its impacts depend on traveller attributes, driver's previous experience, and level of service attributes. Statistically significant explanatory variables in the model are delay for auto, comfort level of rail transit, gender, education level, income, driving experience, driving frequency, main criterion of mode choice, owning an easy public transportation ride card, previous use of P + R, perceived value of existing real-time traveller information and frequency of using real-time traveller information. This study also developed a practical logit model that encompasses policy related explanatory variables to obtain policy implications for real application of SMMI services in Shanghai.
### 173. Information impact on quality of multimodal travel choices: conceptualizations and empirical analyses
> This paper investigates the impact of a variety of travel information types on the quality of travel choices. Choice quality is measured by comparing observed choices made under conditions of incomplete knowledge with predicted choice probabilities under complete knowledge. Furthermore, the potential impact of travel information is considered along multiple attribute-dimensions of alternatives, rather than in terms of travel time reductions only. Data is obtained from a choice experiment in a multimodal travel simulator in combination with a web-based mode-choice experiment. A Structural Equation Model is estimated to test a series of hypothesized direct and indirect relations between a traveler's knowledge levels, information acquisition behavior and the resulting travel-choice quality. The estimation results support the hypothesized relations, which provides evidence of validity and applicability of the developed measure of travel-choice quality. Furthermore, found relations in general provide some careful support for the often expected impact of information on the quality of travel choices. The effects are largest for information services that generate previously unknown alternatives, and lowest for services that provide warnings in case of high travel times only.
### 174. A joint model of travel information acquisition and response to received messages
> This paper presents a discrete-choice model of traveler response to information. It contributes to existing approaches by describing both the acquisition and the effect on travel choices of a variety of travel information types using a single integrative and parsimonious discrete-choice model. By doing so, the model captures the notion that both types of decisions (to acquire information and to execute a travel alternative) are the result of a single underlying system of preferences and beliefs. The model was estimated on choice sequences observed in a multimodal travel simulator experiment with information provision. Estimation results show a good model fit, and parameter estimates have intuitive interpretations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 175. Network modeling approach to transit network design
> Using the Emme/2 Winnipeg demonstration data bank as an example, a practical method is described for developing and defining a multimodal transit network by using standard transport network modeling software. This method. the stand-alone first phase of a three-phase transit-system design process, makes use of conventional, auto assignment techniques. The optimum transit network is found by including demand penalties as a component of the generalized cost of travel on each link.
### 176. A Multiclass, Multimodal Dynamic Traffic Assignment Model with Departure Time
> The paper develops a multiclass, multimodal dynamic traffic equilibrium model with consideration of the departure time choice problem. Travelers choose the departure time and the route simultaneously with a Logit-based structure. The route travel cost is a summation of travel time and schedule delay which is associated with arrival time at destination. In addition, the travelers are classified into three groups according to their value of time. A variational inequality (VI) formulation is proposed based on the equilibrium conditions. Two examples are given to testify the effectiveness of the model and the solution algorithm. The model can give the optimal travel route as well as the best departure time, which would contribute to traffic control and dynamic route guidance.
### 177. A New Multi-Layer Distributed Approach for a Multi-objective Planning Problem
> This paper introduces a new distributed approach to solve multi-objective planning problem applied to multimodal transport network planning (MTNP) problem. In this problem, the commodities should be transported on the international network by at least two different transport modes. The main goal is to find the best multimodal transportation modes and itineraries. The aim of the new approach has assured us that a distributed optimization. We split the MTNP problem into two sub-problems. These sub-problems are the assignment and the planning problems. Each sub-problem is solved at a corresponding layer. Each layer is executed by an agent. These agents interact, collaborate and communicate together to solve the MTNP problem. In this paper, we contribute by introducing a multi-layer distributed approach to solve real case's problems. Firstly, we define the MTNP problem as a distributed constraint satisfaction multi-criteria optimization problem (DCSMOP). Secondly, we show that the split of the main problem reduces the computational complexity and the communication between the planner agent and the modes agents lead to faster convergence. The experimental results are proof of this work efficiently. This method proves their efficiency, according to the complexity of the problem and the exchange of information, the computational time and the solution quality. (C) 2019 The Authors.

### 178. Urban university campus transportation and parking planning through a dynamic traffic simulation and assignment approach
> Many urban university campuses are considered major trip attractors. Considering the multimodal and complex nature of university campus transportation planning and operation, this paper proposes a dynamic traffic simulation and assignment analysis approach and demonstrates how such a methodology can be successfully applied. Central to the research is the estimation of trip origin-destinations and the calibration of a parking lot choice model. Dynamic simulation is utilized to simulate multiple modes of transportation within the transportation network while further assigning these modes with respect to various mode-specific roadway accessibilities. A multiple vehicle-class simulation analysis for planning purposes becomes a critical capability to predict how faculty and staff who once parked within the campus core choose other nearby alternate parking lots. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing integrated and reliable solutions for challenging questions that face urban university campus planners and local transportation jurisdictions.
### 179. Activity-based market equilibrium for capacitated multimodal transport systems
> Empirical studies have shown that demand for multimodal transport systems is highly correlated with activity schedules of individuals. Nonetheless, existing analytical equilibrium models of multimodal systems have only considered trip-based demand. We propose a new market equilibrium model that is sensitive to traveler activity schedules and system capacities. The model is based on a constrained mixed logit model of activity schedule choice, where each schedule in the choice set is generated with a multimodal extension of the household activity pattern problem. The extension explicitly accounts for both passenger choices of activity participation and multimodal choices like public transit, walking, and vehicle parking. The market equilibrium is achieved with Lagrangian relaxation to determine the optimal dual price of the capacity constraint, and a method of successive averages with column generation finds an efficient choice set of activity schedules to assign flows over the dynamic network load capacities. An example illustrates the model and algorithm, effects similar to Vickrey's morning commute model can be observed as a special case. A case study of the Oakville Go Transit station access last mile problem in the Greater Toronto Area is conducted with 166 survey samples reflecting 3680 individuals. Results suggest that a $10 fixed parking fee at Oakville station would lead to a reduction of access auto share from 54.8% to 49.5%, an increase in access transit share from 20.7% to 25.9%, and a disutility increase of 11% for the of single-activity residents of Oakville.

### 180. A Multi-mode Two-Level Transportation Model Based On Network Vulnerability
> Traffic network assignment under road network vulnerability and traffic congestion has become a hot topic for many researchers in recent years. Starting from the complex network characteristics of urban roads and multi-mode traffic network assignment, this paper establishes a multi-mode bilevel transportation model based on network vulnerability which can better reflect different path choice behaviour in a vulnerable network. The upper level is a function of maximizing the capacity of a road network under the investment constraints of the traffic authorities. Its purpose is to minimize the impact of the network operation efficiency and performance after the links or paths are damaged. The lower level is a multi-mode traffic network equilibrium model, which is essentially a traveler behavior assignment problem. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the multimodal traffic model based on vulnerability. The analysis results show that the two-level model considering vulnerability index reduces the impact of abnormal events on the performance of road network, and is conducive to the establishment of a more reliable and stable road network.
### 181. Solving network equilibrium problems on multimodal urban transportation networks with multiple user classes
> A modelling approach for solving quite general network equilibrium problems ( with fixed trip productions and attractions) intrinsic to the urban transport planning process is presented. The framework can consider a variety of demand models and route choice behaviours within the same implementation, including multiple user classes and combined travel modes that interact on the same physical network. The demand choices are assumed to have a hierarchical structure. When trip distribution is variable, a doubly constrained entropy-maximizing model is considered at the first level of choice and a hierarchical logit model is used for the remaining demand choices ( time of departure, travel mode, transfer point for combined modes, etc.). If trip distribution is considered to be exogenous, the demand choices are modelled as a hierarchical logit. One of the main features of the model is that it considers the effects of congestion on the road network as well as congestion and capacity constraints effects in each public transport service network. The problem is formulated mathematically as a variational inequality, with asymmetric cost functions, and solved following the diagonalization procedure. Each iteration of the aforementioned procedure solves an optimization problem using the Evans algorithm. Sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the diagonalized problem are obtained. The main results of a simple example ( solved with an academic version of the proposed algorithm) are presented to show the consistency of the equilibrium flows and levels of services obtained using the model. Finally, a real scale implementation of the model is briefly described to show the feasibility of its application.

### 183. Multimodal transit network design in a hub-and-spoke network framework
> This study focuses on the reconfiguration of bus services in an urban area with a newly constructed rail system. A hub-and-spoke network framework is introduced for the multimodal transit system. The rail services are taken as the backbone, and the bus services (main bus lines and feeder bus lines) are reconfigured to better integrate with rail services forming the core of a Mobility as a Service (MaaS). A cluster-based approach is used for selecting hubs from rail stations. Bus stops are taken as non-hub nodes. Main bus lines are designed based on a heuristic line generation approach and feeder bus lines are developed by solving a travelling salesman problem. A bi-level programming model is proposed to determine frequencies of each mode and addressed by the artificial bee colony algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is illustrated by numerical examples and applied to the Mandl's benchmark compared with existing studies.
### 184. Remote park-and-ride network equilibrium model and its applications
> Existing park-and-ride (P&R) sites are usually located near a train/bus station where construction and operation costs are considerably high. Thus, this paper proposes a new P&R service mode, Remote P&R (RPR), where the car park locates in a suburban area with lower land value. Dedicated express bus service is used to connect this site and a nearby train station. To quantitatively evaluate the impacts of RPR on the network flows, a combined modal split and traffic assignment model (CMSTA) is developed, where a cross-nested logit (CNL) model is adopted to cope with the mode similarity. The problem is formulated as a convex programming model and solved by the Evans algorithm, and then extended to asymmetric path-based cases, where a variational inequality (VI) model is built and solved by a self-adaptive gradient projection (SAGP) algorithm. Taking the CMSTA as the lower level and multimodal stochastic system optimum (MSSO) as the objective, we further develop a mathematical programming model with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) for the optimal network design of RPR. Based on an origin-based reformulation of the MPEC model, an exact solution method based on the nonlinear valid inequalities (NVI) is applied. Numerical examples demonstrate that the RPR services can significantly influence network users' travel decisions, promote the usage of public transportation and mitigate traffic congestion in the congested area of metropolitan cities.

### 185. Time-Dependent Intermodal A* Algorithm: Methodology and Implementation on a Large-Scale Network
> This paper proposes a time-dependent intermodal A* (TDIMA*) algorithm. The algorithm works on a multimodal network with transit, walking, and vehicular network links, and finds paths for the three major modes (transit, walking, driving) and any feasible combination thereof (e.g., park-and-ride). Turn penalties on the vehicular network and progressive transfer penalties on the transit network are considered for improved realism. Moreover, upper bounds to prevent excessive waiting and walking are introduced, as well as an upper bound on driving for the park-and-ride (PNR) mode. The algorithm is validated on the large-scale Chicago Regional network using real-world trips against the Google Directions API and the Regional Transit Authority router.
### 186. Modeling the Effects of Population Density on Prospect Theory-Based Travel Mode-Choice Equilibrium
> In conventional transportation planning models, it was always assumed that the population density is given and fixed in the study areas. Therefore, the effects of population density on travel choice have not been explicitly incorporated into these existing models for long-term transportation planning. Meanwhile, travel choice models in previous studies are usually developed by using discrete choice theories or user equilibrium principle. Thus, many significant characteristics of travelers' behaviors, such as risk preference and learning process over time, cannot be considered in these conventional models. This article proposes a convex prospect theory-based model to investigate the effects of population density on the travelers' mode-choice behavior under an advanced transportation information system (ATIS) in a multimodal transportation corridor. It is shown that population density is closely co-related to the modal split results and dependent on the performance of the railway mode in the study corridor. The park-and-ride mode may not be suitable for areas with high population density. This article also investigates the travelers' reference points on the generalized travel costs by modes. A numerical example is given to illustrate the properties of the proposed model together with some insightful findings.
### 187. Timetable-based simulation method for choice set generation in large-scale public transport networks
> The composition and size of the choice sets are a key for the correct estimation of and prediction by route choice models. While existing literature has posed a great deal of attention towards the generation of path choice sets for private transport problems, the same does not apply to public transport problems. This study proposes a timetable-based simulation method for generating path choice sets in a multimodal public transport network. Moreover, this study illustrates the feasibility of its implementation by applying the method to reproduce 5131 real-life trips in the Greater Copenhagen Area and to assess the choice set quality in a complex multimodal transport network. Results illustrate the applicability of the algorithm and the relevance of the utility specification chosen for the reproduction of real -life path choices. Moreover, results show that the level of stochasticity used in choice set generation should be high in order to provide stable parameter estimates when the choice sets are used for estimation regardless of the initial parameters for choice set generation. Last, results illustrate that adding heterogeneity across travellers should be required because coverage increases significantly, a relevant result considering that models are becoming more disaggregate in nature in real -life applications.
### 188. Modeling the congestion cost and vehicle emission within multimodal traffic network under the condition of equilibrium
> Traditional system optimization models for traffic network focus on the treatment of congestion, which usually have an objective of minimizing the total travel time. However, the negative externality of congestion, such as environment pollution, is neglected in most cases. Such models fall short in taking Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and its impact on climate change into consideration. In this paper, a social-cost based system optimization (SO) model is proposed for the multimodal traffic network considering both traffic congestion and corresponding vehicle emission. Firstly, a variation inequality model is developed to formulate the equilibrium problem for such network based on the analysis of travelers' combined choices. Secondly, the computational models of traffic congestion and vehicle emission of whole multimodal network are proposed based on the equilibrium link-flows and the corresponding travel times. A bi-level programming model, in which the social-cost based SO model is treated as the upper-level problem and the combined equilibrium model is processed as the lower-level problem, is then presented with its solution algorithm. Finally, the proposed models are illustrated through a simple numerical example. The study results confirm and support the idea of giving the priority to the development of urban public transport, which is an effective way to achieve a sustainable urban transportation.
### 189. Shortest hyperpaths in a multimodal hypergraph with real-time information on some transit lines
> This paper presents an algorithm to find multimodal shortest hyperpaths in a transport system where transit arrival is random (i.e. random-arrival transit system), while real-time information on vehicle arrivals is only available for some lines and modes. When the algorithm is queried, there is a short horizon where real-time information is accurate, and past this the most reliable information for estimating the arrivals is to use a random distribution specific to the lines. This problem occurs frequently in emerging cities where the transit schedules are not maintained. A Combined Real-Time Hypergraph is constructed to model the multimodal transport system where all the public transport modes have random arrivals and real-time information on arrivals is available for some lines of some modes. In order to model the period of time when some lines have real-time information, the composition of the head nodes of hyperarcs changes over time. The algorithm is tested on a real-life transport system where we change the number of lines with available real-time information to assess the performance of the algorithm in different scenarios. We found that incrementing the number of lines with real-time information does not impact the performance.
### 190. Integrated Frequency Allocation and User Assignment in Multimodal Transit Networks Methodology and Application to Large-Scale Urban Systems
> This paper presents an integrated solution method to the frequency. setting problem using optimization and assignment simulation. With a bilevel solution framework, an optimization problem is run at the upper level under the assumption that the total transit demand is fixed. The objective is to maximize wait time savings under the budget, fleet size, vehicle load, and policy headway constraints. At the lower level, an assignment and simulation algorithm is run; the algorithm models the demand response to the new frequency setting and transmits updated ridership and flow values to the upper level. The procedure is repeated until the improvement in the wait time savings converges. The platform is tested on the Chicago Transit Authority network in Illinois for the morning peak. The wait time savings in this experiment are converging and are found to be comparable with the results of a stand-alone frequency-setting algorithm that finds optimal solutions. Results are comparable with the optimal results of a stand-alone platform introduced in another study that modeled the demand response locally by using elasticities as opposed to networkwide modeling using assignment. The integrated platform can be used for medium-term strategic and long-term planning decisions.
### 191. Modelling the impact of alternative pricing policies on an urban multimodal traffic corridor
> This paper investigates the effects of alternative or joint schemes of road pricing and parking pricing to verify if private behaviour in operating parking facilities, road tolling and transit systems can lead to profitable results in the private sector and for public welfare. The evaluation is carried out using an idealised urban multimodal traffic corridor with some numerical examples that show the effects of different pricing policies. A Deterministic User Equilibrium assignment procedure is used to calculate certain performance indicators such as user travel costs, social costs and private profit. The results show that the system is highly sensitive to pricing policy and that a proper joint pricing of park-and-ride facilities, city centre parking and road tolls can be developed to simultaneously attain good private and social benefits.

### 192. Geographic information system design for network equilibrium-based travel demand models
> Travel demand analyses are useful for transportation planning and policy development in a study area. However, travel demand modeling faces two obstacles. First, standard practice solves the four travel components (trip generation, trip distribution, modal split and network assignment) in a sequential manner. This can result in inconsistencies and non-convergence. Second, the data required are often complex and difficult to manage. Recent advances in formal methods for network equilibrium-based travel demand modeling and computational platforms for spatial data handling can overcome these obstacles. In this paper we report on the development of a prototype geographic information system (GIS) design to support network equilibrium-based travel demand models. The GIS design has several key features, including: (i) realistic representation of the multimodal transportation network, (ii) increased likelihood of database integrity after updates, (iii) effective user interfaces, and (iv) efficient implementation of network equilibrium solution algorithms.

### 193. Modeling Transit and Intermodal Tours in a Dynamic Multimodal Network
> A fixed-point formulation and a simulation-based solution method were developed for modeling intermodal passenger tours in a dynamic transportation network. The model proposed in this paper is a combined model of a dynamic traffic assignment, a schedule-based transit assignment, and a park-and-ride choice model, which assigns intermodal demand (i.e., passengers with drive-to-transit mode) to the optimal park-and-ride station. The proposed model accounts for all segments of passenger tours in the passengers' daily travel, incorporates the constraint on returning to the same park-and-ride location in a tour, and models individual passengers at a disaggregate level. The model has been applied in an integrated travel demand model in Sacramento, California, and feedback to the activity-based demand model is provided through separate time-dependent skim tables for auto, transit, and intermodal trips.
### 194. A many-to-many assignment game and stable outcome algorithm to evaluate collaborative mobility-as-a-service platforms
> As Mobility as a Service (MaaS) systems become increasingly popular, travel is changing from unimodal trips to personalized services offered by a platform of mobility operators. Evaluation of MaaS platforms depends on modeling both user route decisions as well as operator service and pricing decisions. We adopt a new paradigm for traffic assignment in a MaaS network of multiple operators using the concept of stable matching to allocate costs and determine prices offered by operators corresponding to user route choices and operator service choices without resorting to nonconvex bilevel programming formulations. Unlike our prior work, the proposed model allows travelers to make multimodal, multi-operator trips, resulting in stable cost allocations between competing network operators to provide MaaS for users. An algorithm is proposed to efficiently generate stability conditions for the stable outcome model. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the use of the model to handling pricing responses of MaaS operators in technological and capacity changes, government acquisition, consolidation, and firm entry, using the classic Sioux Falls network. The proposed algorithm replicates the same stability conditions as explicit path enumeration while taking only 17 seconds compared to explicit path enumeration timing out over 2 hours.

### 195. Transit competitiveness in polycentric metropolitan regions
> This paper analyzes the potential to, and impacts of, increasing transit modal split in a polycentric metropolitan area the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania region. Potential transit riders are preselected as those travelers whose trips begin and end in areas with transit-supportive land uses, defined as activity centers, areas of high-density employment and trip attraction. A multimodal traffic assignment model is developed and solved to quantify the generalized cost of travel by transit services and private automobile under (user) equilibrium conditions. The model predicts transit modal split by identifying the origin-destination pairs for which transit offers lower generalized cost. For those origin-destination pairs for which transit does not offer the lowest generalized cost, I compute a transit competitiveness measure, the ratio of transit generalized cost to auto generalized cost. The model is first formulated and solved for existing transit service and regional pricing schemes. Next, various transit incentives (travel time or fare reductions, increased service) and auto disincentives (higher out of pocket expenses) are proposed and their impacts on individual travel choices and system performance are quantified. The results suggest that a coordinated policy of improved transit service and some auto disincentives is necessary to achieve greater modal split and improved system efficiency in the region. Further, the research finds that two levels of coordinated transit service, between and within activity centers, are necessary to realize the greatest improvements in system performance.

### 196. Joint Travel Demand and Environmental Model to Incorporate Emission Pricing for Large Transportation Networks
> Emission reduction strategies are gaining greater attention as a support of the national objective for a sustainable and green transportation system. A large percentage of the emission contribution that arises from transportation modes are primarily from auto and truck travel. Reductions in highway travel require prudent planning strategies and modeling user response to planner's policies. Modeling planning goals and user response is a challenging task. In this paper a joint travel demand and environmental model incorporates vehicle emission pricing (VEP) as a strategy for emission reduction. First, the travel demand model determines the destination, mode, and route choice of the users in response to the VEP strategy set by the planner. Second, the emission model provides oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, and carbon dioxide estimates at a very detailed level. A base case and three models incorporate VEP in a multimodal transportation network. The objective function of the base case is the minimization of total system travel time, and the models are designed with the objective of minimizing total system emissions. The user equilibrium method is used for travel to model user responses and is solved by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. The base case represents do-nothing conditions, and the three models address the interactions between planner's perspectives and user responses to VEP strategies. The proposed model is applied to the multimodal transportation network of Montgomery County (located in the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore, Maryland, region). The case study results show that VEP can be used as a tool for emission reduction in transportation planning and policy.
### 197. Route Redundancy-Based Network Topology Measure of Metro Networks
> The metro system plays a very important role in the urban multimodal transportation system, yet it is susceptible to accidents. A well-designed metro system needs to provide alternative routes to travellers both in the disruptive events and the normal operating conditions for providing rerouting opportunities and balancing crowded lines. This paper provides a new dimension of assessing metro network performance-travellers' route redundancy (or route diversity), which is defined as the number of behaviourally effective routes between each origin-destination (O-D) pair in the network. The route redundancy of metro network is evaluated by statistical indicators of the distribution of the O-D-level number of effective routes. Compared with the existing connectivity and accessibility measures of topology network performance, route redundancy is also based on the topology network, but it takes the travellers' route choice into consideration. Specifically, the effective routes between each O-D pair would provide disaggregated information from the travellers' perspective. Case studies in four metropolises in the world, i.e., Shanghai, Beijing, London, and Tokyo, are conducted to examine the predisaster preparedness of the four metro networks explicitly from the perspective of route redundancy. The results indicate that the London metro network has the best route redundancy performance in terms of the statistical indicators of the distribution of the O-D level number of effective routes. Furthermore, the results of route redundancy are compared with typical measures of topology network performance in terms of measuring connectivity and accessibility of metro networks. Their differences are attributed to the fact that the route redundancy measure considers the travellers' O-D-level route choice beyond the pure network topology and the shortest path considerations of the existing measures. The route redundancy proposed in this paper could assist in evaluating the predisaster preparedness of current or planning metro networks from O-D level to network level.
### 198. Social Welfare Maximization of Multimodal Transportation Theory, Metamodel, and Application to Tianjin Ecocity, China
> Multimodal urban transportation systems exhibit complex interactions between components, including users, multimodal transportation facilities, supply side agencies, and operators. Although these interactions are obvious, rigorous quantitative methods for optimizing control variables across modes of transportation on real-world networks are deficient. A social welfare maximization model was established for joint optimization of bus fare, rail transit fare, and congestion tolls for private cars. The authors determined the optimality conditions and the second-order partial derivatives for this optimization problem. Because of the complexity of the multimodal urban transportation system, the objective function of social welfare has no closed form and is extremely expensive to evaluate. The authors therefore proposed a simulation-based framework for evaluation of the objective function and optimization of three decision variables across multiple travel modes. Several metamodels (i.e., mathematical functions that approximate the true shape of an unknown, nonlinear, and complex objective function) were adopted to approximate the highly nonlinear input-output mappings in the urban system. This is the first study to develop a simulation-based method for joint optimization of transit and road network operations. The case study applied the simulation-based optimization framework to the Sino-Singapore ecocity in Tianjin, China, by using VISSUM as the urban systems simulator. An ecocity is defined by the authors as a thriving city that is socially harmonious, environmentally friendly, resource-efficient, and a model for sustainable development. Results show that metamodels can accurately approximate the real objective function and produce good suboptimal and near-optimal solutions. The optimal combination of transit fares and congestion tolls significantly outperform those under two baseline scenarios. The optimal solutions also suggest that extreme transit fares (too high or too low) or congestion tolls are contrary to welfare-maximizing objectives. The proposed method can be applied for joint optimization of other multimodal planning and operational strategies, such as investment and operational decisions across various modes of transportation.
### 199. Hierarchical network-based equilibrium model and algorithm for a mixed-traffic urban transport system
> Many equilibrium models and algorithms based on homogeneous motorized traffic have been devised to model urban transport systems in developed countries, but they are inadequate when it comes to represent mixed-traffic urban transport systems, including automobiles, transit, bicycles, and pedestrians, in developing countries such as China or India. In these cases, traffic flow on a road segment is an aggregated result of travellers' combined mode/route choices and corresponding interactions. Therefore, a special assignment model and algorithm are needed for modeling these distinct behaviors. In this article, the structure of a mixed-traffic urban transport system is analyzed and then expanded and represented using a hierarchical network model based on graph theory. Based on the analysis of travelers' combined mode/route choices, generalized travel cost functions and link impedance functions for different modes are formulated, where the interferences between different modes on the same road segments are taken into account. Due to the 'asymmetric' nature of these functions, a variational inequality model is proposed to represent the equilibrium assignment problem in a mixed-traffic urban transport system. The corresponding solution algorithm is also presented. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the practicality of the proposed model and algorithm.
### 200. A general activity-based methodology for simulating multimodal transportation networks during emergencies
> Many possible emergency conditions, including evacuations, negatively affect the urban transportation system by substantially increasing the travel demand and/or reducing the supplied capacity. A transportation model can be used to quantify and understand the impact of the underlying disasters and corresponding management strategies. To this end, we develop an efficient methodology suitable for simulating multimodal transportation systems affected by emergencies, based on the novel integration of an activity-based choice model with both pre-trip and en-route choices, and a macroscopic or mesoscopic dynamic network loading model. The model structure first estimates the daily equilibrium and then uses that result as a starting point to simulate the emergency situation without further iterations. Unlike previous efforts, our methodology satisfies all requirements identified from literature regarding transportation modeling for emergencies, and is sufficiently general to investigate a wide range of emergency situations and management strategies. An evacuation case study for Delft shows the feasibility of applying the methodology. Furthermore, it yields practical insights for urban evacuation planning that stem from complex system dynamics, such as important interactions among travel directions and among modes. This supports the need for a comprehensive modeling methodology such as the one we present in this paper.
### 201. Route Planning Methodology with Four-step Model and Dynamic Assignments
> Nowadays plenty of navigation and route guidance methodologies are available, based on real-time traffic information collected from technologies that have not been originally developed to measure road traffic parameters, for example, cellular and GPS data of users' mobile phones and their current travel demands. Traditional traffic estimation methodologies, such as the four-step model, are not frequently employed. This way, reliable traffic data can only be obtained for those areas where there are enough users. In our paper, we present a route guidance methodology that combines current transportation demands with the results of the traditional four-step model. The predicted traffic state of the network is calculated for every fifteen minutes of the day by using a dynamic assignment with predefined static demand matrices as a first assignment. When travelers use the route suggestion system, their demands are collected in an actual demand matrix for the same time interval. This matrix is then combined with the original static demand matrix for this period and then allocated to the network as a second assignment. The real-time traffic disruptions on the network are also taken into account. Users will be provided with route suggestions based on the combination of the results of the two assignments. The methodology is tested with real static demand and network data of Budapest, using an integrated multimodal transport model maintained by the BKK Centre for Budapest Transport. The actual demands are simulated, modelling various traffic situations.(C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
### 202. Scheduled service network design with resource management for two-tier multimodal city logistics
> We address the tactical-planning problem for an extended two-tiered City Logistics system. This more realistic problem setting, compared to the literature, integrates inbound and outbound demands, different transportation modes combining traditional, road-based, carriers with modes and vehicles of mass transport, such as light and regular rail. Aside from the assignment of customers to consolidation distribution centers and satellites, we manage a number of major resources, such as the multiple satellite capacity measures and the structure, allocation, and size of the heterogeneous fleets. We propose a scheduled service network design formulation for the tactical planning of such extended systems, and develop an efficient Benders decomposition algorithm, which includes a tailored partial decomposition technique for deterministic mixed-integer linear-programming formulations. The results of extensive numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed solution method, as well as the benefits of integrating several demand types and multimodal transportation networks into a single formulation.

### 203. Multimodal Mesoscopic Approach in Modeling Pedestrian Evacuation
> A recently funded research project in Italy concerned reduction In risk exposure in urban areas through the definition and the implementation of evacuation procedures. One of the research aims was to specify and calibrate a system of models that could simulate the transportation system when a population must evacuate because of approaching disaster. Various activities were conducted to calibrate a set of cost functions to be implemented within a dynamic network loading procedure to simulate pedestrian outflow related to the evacuation of a building. How flow models are calibrated on the basis of data collected during experimentation at a test site is shown, and the results of their implementation within a multimodal dynamic loading model used to simulate evacuation procedures are described. A comparison between experimental data and simulation results shows that the use of appropriate simulation models can realistically reproduce user behavior and then shows how such models can be used as a support for creating effective evacuation plans. The experimentation involved evacuation of a primary school in an Italian town, but the method applied can be adapted easily to any public building with homogenous characteristics.
### 204. TIME AND SPACE SCHEDULING OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT NETWORKS AND THE EVALUATION OF QUALITY OF SERVICE
> Most of the work being done in public transport scheduling has been concerned with the economics of production, namely with the aim of reducing idle times of buses and crews. But, especially in large urban areas, there is also a need for tools that allow the management of transit companies to organise their supply in such a way that the perceived quality of the service they provide is as good as possible. To a large extent, that quality of service depends on the time and space scheduling of supply, that is, on the spatial organisation of the network and, if the frequency of service is relatively low, also on the timetable of services provided. Each of the users of a transit network develops his own (partial) vision of that network, but it is the job of the company to have a global vision of the system and judge how well it suits users needs. The paper presents a software package developed to represent and evaluate public transit multimodal networks based on the modelling of route choice by the users, along with experience from its application in the restructuring and expansion of transit networks in Lisbon and Porto.
### 205. A modelling platform for optimizing time-dependent transit fares in large-scale multimodal networks
> With the continuous growth of urban areas around the world, overcrowding in large transit networks has become a persistent problem, with far-reaching impacts similar to those caused by congestion in large road networks. Moreover, instead of serving as a relief for large transportation systems, congested transit networks have increased delay-related traffic and transit costs. In light of these problems, cities seek cost-effective and relatively fast-to-implement strategies to mitigate transit system congestion, one of which is time-based fare structures. By implementing time-based fares, the transit demand may shift out of the congested peak periods, easing transit travel conditions. Although time-based fares are already in use in some transportation systems, their implementation is usually based on simplified what-if analyses. Such analyses of fare structures in previous studies have lacked a comprehensive evaluation of people's responses to these fares and is usually applied to simple or sometimes hypothetical transportation networks. Therefore, this paper presents a platform for analyzing and optimizing time-based transit fares in large networks, taking into consideration the effects of these fares on people's choices of mode, departure time, and route in addition to the interactions between transit vehicles and general traffic. As a case study, the largest metropolitan area in Canada, the Greater Toronto Area, is tested. The results show that the optimal time-based fares help spread the transit demand to the shoulders of the peak. However, the savings in weighted average multimodal door-to-door travel time over the whole network are slightly small compared to the large increase in peak-hour fares.
### 206. Optimisation models for the urban parking pricing problem
> Parking pricing strategies are important tools for rebalancing the modal split between private car and transit systems in urban areas. Indeed, high congestion levels are mainly due to users' preference for the private car system. In order to obtain a more balanced modal split it is possible, together with an improvement in transit system quality, to set fees on the use of private cars through road pricing and/or parking pricing strategies. Parking pricing strategies are simpler, since they can be managed without adopting advanced technologies. In this paper some parking pricing strategies are proposed and some optimisation models are formalised. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 207. Using trajectory data to explore roadway characterization for bikeshare network
> The rapid expansion of bikeshare programs nationwide provides opportunities to gain insights on the optimal development of multimodal networks and bike-friendly environments. The profusion of trajectory-level data produced by bikeshare systems allows for information extraction on users' route preferences and, if modeled properly, will lead to a greater understanding of road characteristics that are appealing to bikeshare users. Leveraging Global Positioning System (GPS) data obtained from the GREENbike program, this study proposes a method to characterize roadways (e.g. collector, peripheral road, attractive road, and local road) on the basis of a variety of network centrality functions. The methodology is able to uncover the structure of the underlying transportation network and identify locations of critical bicycle infrastructures. A series of centrality measures, including degree, shortest-path betweenness, and random-walk betweenness centrality are implemented to determine the roadway classifications. Their suitability and usability for this purpose is then explored and discussed at length through a sensitivity analysis. The method can be applied to any bikeshare system that has access to trajectory-level (i.e. GPS, crowdsourcing) data for identifying road attributes that are appealing to bike users. Results can effectively guide future investment choices.
### 208. Park-and-Ride Choice Behavior in a Multimodal Network with Overlapping Routes
> This study estimates a discrete choice model from on-board survey data for park-and-ride (PNR) user's station choice, and finds that users prefer a higher proportion of their trip time spent on transit than in a car. No evidence is found that users choose the PNR location that minimizes their overall travel time, but there is strong evidence that PNR locations closer to the direction of their destination are preferred. No significant relationship is found between PNR choice, user age, income, or gender. PNR facility amenities are found to be insignificant across all models tested, and the rail and bus rapid transit service provide a significant benefit to PNR user utility when compared to the express bus service. This study contributes to existing literature by accounting for route overlap among alternatives using a path size factor in the logit model estimation. A nested logit model for different transit types is estimated, but is surpassed in predictive ability by a multinomial and mixed logit model. Ultimately, the models are found to predict transit route choice more accurately than PNR location choice, improving on the PNR choice prediction by about 11%. Similarly, choice set alternatives that overlap with a user's observed route are found to generally have higher choice probabilities than non-overlapping alternatives.
### 209. Formulation of analytical time-varying intermodal person trip assignment model
> An analytical formulation of the intermodal dynamic traffic assignment problem is presented. The model is a cell transmission-based, single-destination, system optimal integer linear programming formulation for a multimodal network of cars and buses. The computational tests demonstrate interesting insights into the complex interactions between travelers' intermodal path choices and traffic movements. Specifically, as with many analytical time-varying traffic models, the constraints regulate flow, while the objective function provides an incentive for travelers to progress on least-cost paths toward the cost-free trip termination cells. It is found that difficulties relate to this reliance on costs to advance travelers and vehicles; for example, the non-first-in-first-out propagation of buses ahead of automobiles is a result of the higher cost incurred by numerous riders on a single bus vehicle. Similarly, the model's tendency to hold buses at bus stops or force buses to skip bus stops results from a difference in costs incurred by travelers who would be better served by the holding of the bus or by the skipping of a stop. On the basis of the findings on the model's behavior, recommendations are made for the future development of time-varying intermodal routing problems.
### 210. Modeling park-and-ride services in a multimodal transport network with elastic demand
> With the rapid development of metro systems in large Asian cities, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, China, local authorities are developing park-and-ride (P&R) schemes to encourage commuters to reach the cities' central areas by transferring from private cars to metro at stations with P&R facilities. A network equilibrium formulation can be used to model P&R services in a multimodal transportation network with elastic demand. It is assumed that commuters can complete their journeys by three options: auto mode, walk-metro mode, and P&R mode. The proposed model simultaneously considered commuters' travel choices on travel mode, route-path, and transfer point, as well as their parking choice behavior. The effects of elastic travel demand, together with passengers' discomfort in metro vehicles, were explicitly incorporated. The resultant problem can be formulated as an equivalent variational inequality problem. Numerical results showed that the introduction of P&R schemes could bring a positive, neutral, or even negative social welfare increment, and its efficiency depends greatly on. the parking charging level and the number of parking spaces supplied at. the P&R site and in the urban central area, as well as the metro dispatching frequency and fare.
### 211. A coupled linear programming model with geospatial dynamic trip assignment for global-scale intermodal transportation
> We present an ad hoc geospatial origin-destination model that utilizes the rudiments of operations research optimization techniques to estimate feasible multimodal routes that may or may not be geospatially connected. The model is designed to determine and optimize large-scale container flows from US trade partners to inland markets mainly located within the lower 48 states. The dynamic traffic assignment for the freight flow considers several factors such as congestion, volume/capacity (V/C) ratio, throughput and distance-based impedance and the Geographic Information Systems platform provides a visualization environment for all feasible routes. Visual analytics with the resultant geographical distribution maps indicate that maritime containers are concentrated on the West Coast whereas rail shipments are densely concentrated along rail transshipment points such as Chicago, Memphis and Dallas. The highway transportation densities are mainly visible with origins from marine ports to associated market destinations starting from hinterland and radiating further away from these primal areas to other inland intermodal terminals that serve major landlocked metropolitan cities that are not served by railway networks. Our critical finding indicates that some routes, which are not generally considered as prime routes, may actually offer the best alternatives especially when considering global supply chains.
### 212. Open-Source Public Transportation Mobility Simulation Engine DTALite-S: A Discretized Space-Time Network-Based Modeling Framework for Bridging Multi-agent Simulation and Optimization
> Recently, an open-source light-weight dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) package, namely DTALite, has been developed to allow a rapid utilization of advanced dynamic traffic analysis capabilities. Aiming to bridge the modeling gaps between multi-agent simulation and optimization in a multimodal environment, we further design and develop DTALite-S to simplify the traffic flow dynamic representation details in DTALite for future extensions. We hope to offer a unified modeling framework with inherently consistent space-time network representations for both optimization formulation and simulation process. This paper includes three major modeling components: (1) mathematic formulations to describe traffic and public transportation simulation problem on a spacetime network; (2) transportation transition dynamics involving multiple agents in the optimization process; (3) an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based modeling structure to link different features between multi-agent simulation and optimization used in transportation. This unified framework can be embedded in a Lagrangian relaxation method and a time-oriented sequential simulation procedure to handle many general applications. We carried out a case study by using this unified framework to simulate the passenger traveling process in Beijing subway network which contains 18 urban rail transit lines, 343 stations, and 52 transfer stations. Via the ADMM-based solution approach, queue lengths at platforms, in-vehicle congestion levels and absolute deviation of travel times are obtained within 1560 seconds. The case study indicate that the open-source DTALite-S integrates simulation and optimization procedure for complex dynamic transportation systems and can efficiently generate comprehensive space-time traveling status.
### 213. A multiclass simultaneous transportation equilibrium model
> Single class travel forecasting models assume that all travelers are similar in their travel-decision characteristics, such as their money-value of the time and their sensitivity to travel times in choosing their origin, destination and mode of travel, etc. To obtain more realistic models, travelers are often divided into classes, either by socio-economic attributes (e.g., income level, car availability, etc.) or by the purpose (e.g., home-based-work, non-home-based-work, home-based-shopping, etc.) of their travel, assuming that travel-decision characteristics are the same within each class, but differ among classes. However, the development of this concept of multiple classes increases the mathematical complexity of travel forecasting models. All the existing multiclass combined models consider the trip generation step of transportation planning process is exogenous to the combined prediction process. In this paper we enhance the Simultaneous Transportation Equilibrium Model (STEM) that developed by Safwat and Magnanti in 1988, and explicitly combined trip generation step, to be a multiclass model in terms of socio-economic group, trip purpose, pure and combined transportation modes, as well as departure time, all interacting over a physically unique multimodal network. The developed Multiclass Simultaneous Transportation Equilibrium Model (MSTEM) is formulated as a Variational Inequality problem and a diagonalization algorithm is proposed to solve it.
### 214. Evaluation of operational and environmental sustainability tradeoffs in multimodal freight transportation planning
> Transportation planners often need to justify transportation related investments to public officials. Besides efficiency measures, the environment protection and sustainability are gaining more and more importance. In order to improve freight flow efficiency in a sustainable way, it is necessary to have a systematic tool to study the freight flow over all three major surface modes and their connections and, in turn, to help public officials identify the best way to improve freight transportation. We built a system-level intermodal simulation model that includes highways, railways, and waterways because all three modes, working together, play significant roles in freight flows. We evaluated the performance of the Louisiana freight network under different scenarios and measured the benefits of mode changes evaluating the tradeoff between environmental goals and other performance measures.
### 215. Evaluating OpenStreetMap's Performance Potential for Level of Traffic Stress Analysis
> Increasingly, metropolitan areas are prioritizing growth in the share of trips taken by bicycle to improve health outcomes, transportation affordability, and environmental performance of the transport system. Evidence is building that network quality is an important determinant in bicycle commuting and route choice. One prominent metric of facility attractiveness is bicycle level of traffic stress (LTS). In tandem, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is becoming an important source of network data for routing and for generating measures of multimodal accessibility. Although there are studies that examine the completeness of OSM tags and utilize OSM data to compute LTS on networks, none of them examine the accuracy of these analyses. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of OSM-derived LTS predictions and offer quality assurance strategies to reduce inaccurate predictions. This study compares OSM-derived LTS predictions with ground-truthed LTS scores created by Montgomery County. It finds that OSM-derived LTS networks provide comparable results to the ground-truthed data. The OSM-derived LTS scores correctly identified 89.9% of the length of the network as either high (LTS 3 or 4) or low stress (LTS 1 or 2). However, this study demonstrates there is a higher potential for error within certain street typologies and urban contexts, and that low-stress accessibility calculations can be very sensitive to even a small number of incorrectly classified segments. Finally, practices to improve the quality of OSM-derived LTS predictions and low-stress accessibility calculations are suggested.
### 216. The bi-objective multimodal car-sharing problem
> The aim of the bi-objective multimodal car-sharing problem (BiO-MMCP) is to determine the optimal mode of transport assignment for trips and to schedule the routes of available cars and users whilst minimizing cost and maximizing user satisfaction. We investigate the BiO-MMCP from a user-centred point of view. As user satisfaction is a crucial aspect in shared mobility systems, we consider user preferences in a second objective. Users may choose and rank their preferred modes of transport for different times of the day. In this way, we account for, e.g., different traffic conditions throughout the planning horizon. We study different variants of the problem. In the base problem, the sequence of tasks a user has to fulfil is fixed in advance and travel times as well as preferences are constant over the planning horizon. In variant 2, time-dependent travel times and preferences are introduced. In variant 3, we examine the challenges when allowing additional routing decisions. Variant 4 integrates variants 2 and 3. For this last variant, we develop a branch-andcut algorithm which is embedded in two bi-objective frameworks, namely the epsilon-constraint method and a weighting binary search method. Computational experiments show that the branch-and cut algorithm outperforms the MIP formulation and we discuss changing solutions along the Pareto frontier.
### 217. Rule-Based Mode Choice Model: INSIM Expert System
> This paper presents an innovative rule-based intelligent network simulation model (INSIM) expert system (IES) which simulates real-time mode choice decision-making process of commuters in the presence of multimodal traveler information. The IES captures interactions among available modes and decides on the commuter's mode based on a commuter's socioeconomic traits and prevailing travel condition. The commuter's mode choice behavior is modeled and represented by cognitive rules in the rule-base of the IES. Two important characteristics of the IES, the reliability and the adaptive learning, are highlighted. Three different models, i.e., (1) pure rule-based model (PRB), (2) discrete choice model (DCM), and (3) probabilistic model (COM) are introduced to formulate the mode choice decisions. Simulation results show that the highest level of accuracy can be achieved by applying the PRB model to generate mode choice decisions. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.
### 218. Optimization of Large Transport Networks Using the Ant Colony Heuristic
> Long-term transportation planning for larger regions must assess synergies and interference among sets of projects. The objective is the maximization of the overall benefit within specific budget restrictions by finding the most favorable bundle of projects, that is, solving the network design problem. For large numbers of projects, complete enumeration of all combinations is not feasible for detailed networks. The ant colony heuristic is suitable for this kind of problem. According to our knowledge, this article presents the above-mentioned heuristic's first application to a realistically sized network. A detailed multimodal network assignment of a substantial Swiss city provides the basis for calculations. First, each infrastructure project is assessed using a cost-benefit analysis. The ant colony heuristic is then successfully executed and the bundles are evaluated. The article provides new insights into applications of the heuristic in large networks and focuses on problematic calibration details as well as the choice of objective function. Suggestions are made for general applications and further research.
### 219. Parking capacity and pricing in park'n ride trips: A continuous equilibrium network design problem
> In this paper we consider the problem of designing parking facilities for park'n ride trips. We present a new continuous equilibrium network design problem to decide the capacity and fare of these parking lots at a tactical level. We assume that the parking facilities have already been located and other topological decisions have already been taken. The modeling approach proposed is mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints. In the outer optimization problem, a central Authority evaluates the performance of the transport network for each network design decision. In the inner problem a multimodal traffic assignment with combined modes, formulated as a variational inequality problem, generates the share demand for modes of transportation, and for parking facilities as a function of the design variables of the parking lots. The objective is to make optimal parking investment and pricing decisions in order to minimize the total travel cost in a subnetwork of the multimodal transportation system. We present a new development in model formulation based on the use of generalized parking link cost as a design variable. The bilevel model is solved by a simulated annealing algorithm applied to the continuous and non-negative design decision variables. Numerical tests are reported in order to illustrate the use of the model, and the ability of the approach to solve applications of moderate size.
### 220. Optimization of a Bus and Rail Transit System with Feeder Bus Services under Different Market Regimes
> This paper proposes analytical models for optimizing a bus and rail transit system with feeder bus services under different market regimes. The market regimes concerned include: monopoly (with profit maximization), social optimum (with social welfare maximization), and oligopoly. In the proposed models, transit operator aims to optimize the frequencies and fares of the bus, rail and feeder bus services, while accounting for the responses from transit passengers (in terms of travel mode choice as well as demand elasticity) to the level of transit services and fares. A solution algorithm is developed to solve the proposed models. Numerical results show that a single implementation of the feeder bus service scheme may not be most cost-effective. A joint implementation of the feeder bus service scheme and other schemes, such as transfer coordination between transit modes and integrated fare scheme, can significantly improve the performance of the multimodal transit system in terms of total social welfare.
### 221. Planning Shared Corporate Mobility Services
> In a corporate context, individual mobility of employees is often addressed by owning cars instead of using mobility at least in Austria. Therefore, the national research project SEAMLESS Sustainable, Efficient Austrian Mobility with Low-Emission Shared Systems aims at providing novel company mobility services considering private and business trips. The idea is to shift from owning overdimensioned and underutilized cars towards using sustainable and flexible mobility offers including car pools, bike sharing, taxis, and/or public transportation services. The goal is to achieve a more efficient utilization and possibly a reduction of the company fleet as well as a significant CO2 reduction by fostering the usage of the aforementioned alternatives. In order to achieve this, not only business culture and employees' perception have to be investigated but also a thorough technical support must be provided. Within the model presented in this work, we focus on fulfilling the original mobility demand by incorporating alternative mobility modes such as shared (e-)cars and bikes, or public transport. At the same time, side constraints related to e mobility (e.g., temporal load distribution to avoid peaks on the energy grids) are considered. The resulting models aim at combining different well-known and so-far mostly individually considered problems like electric vehicle routing with time windows, fleet size and mix, vehicle-to-tour assignment, battery load management, and general fleet management operations. In this work, we will report on first mixed integer linear optimization models focusing on multimodal mobility and fleet management. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

### 222. Modeling Carrier Interactions in an International Freight Transport System
> This paper presents a novel multi-level hierarchical approach which models carrier interactions in international maritime freight transportation networks. Ocean carriers, land carriers and port terminal operators are considered. Port terminal operators, providing transportation services within a port complex, are regarded as a special type of the carrier, based on their behavior. The carriers make pricing and routing decisions at different parts of the multimodal network, having hierarchical relationships. Ocean carriers are regarded as the leaders in a maritime shipping market. Port terminal operators are the followers of ocean carriers as well as the leaders of land carriers. The individual carrier problem is formulated at each level using Nash equilibrium to find the optimal service charge and routing pattern for which each carrier obtains the greatest profit. Interactions among different types of carriers are captured in a three-level model. The concept of multi-leader-follower game is applied to a multi-level game. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the validity of the developed three-level model.
### 223. Intermodal Path Algorithm for Time-Dependent Auto Network and Scheduled Transit Service
> A simple but efficient algorithm is proposed for finding the optimal path in an intermodal urban transportation network. The network is a general transportation network with multiple modes (auto, bus, rail, walk, etc.) divided into the two major categories of private and public, with proper transfer constraints. The goal was to find the optimal path according to the generalized cost, including private-side travel cost, public-side travel cost, and transfer cost. A detailed network model of transfers between modes was used to improve the accounting of travel times during these transfers. The intermodal path algorithm was a sequential application of specific cases of transit and auto shortest paths and resulted in the optimal intermodal path, with the optimal park-and-ride location for transferring from private to public modes. The computational complexity of the algorithm was shown to be a significant improvement over existing algorithms. The algorithm was applied to a real network within a dynamic traffic and transit assignment procedure and integrated with a sequential activity choice model.
### 224. Day-to-day modal choice with a Pareto improvement or zero-sum revenue scheme
> We investigate the day-to-day modal choice of commuters in a bi-modal transportation system comprising both private transport and public transit. On each day, commuters adjust their modal choice, based on the previous day's perceived travel cost and intraday toll or subsidy of each mode, to minimize their perceived travel cost. Meanwhile, the transportation authority sets the number of bus runs and the tolls or subsidies of two modes on each day, based on the previous day's modal choice of commuters, to simultaneously reduce the daily total actual travel cost of the transportation system and achieve a Pareto improvement or zero-sum revenue target at a stationary state. The evolution process of the modal choice of commuters, associated with the strategy adjustment process of the authority, is formulated as a dynamical system model. We analyze several properties of the dynamical system with respect to its stationary point and evolutionary trajectory. Moreover, we introduce new concepts of Pareto improvement and zero-sum revenue in a day-to-day dynamic setting and propose the two targets' implementations in either a prior or a posterior form. We show that, although commuters have different perceived travel costs for using the same travel mode, the authority need not know the probability distribution of perceived travel costs of commuters to achieve the Pareto improvement target. Finally, we give a set of numerical examples to show the properties of the model and the implementation of the toll or subsidy schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
### 225. A Credit-Based Congestion Management Scheme in General Two-Mode Networks with Multiclass Users
> This paper examines the design of the credit-based congestion management schemes that achieve Pareto-improving outcome in general two-mode networks. It is assumed that transit is a slower but cheaper alternative to driving alone. The distributional welfare effects of congestion pricing on users with the different value of time (VOT) in Liu and Nie (Trans Res Board 2283:34-43, 2012) are used in developing Pareto-improving credit schemes. We show that, similar to the single-mode model, the sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a discriminatory Pareto-improving credit scheme is the reduction in the total system cost. A sufficient condition for the existence of an anonymous Pareto-improving credit scheme is also derived. A cross-OD subsidization scheme is proposed when the sufficient condition is not satisfied for each origin-destination (O-D) pair. Numerical experiments on the expanded Sioux Falls networks with a log-normal VOT distribution demonstrate that the proposed Pareto-improving scheme can generate positive net revenue in the presence of good transit coverage.
### 226. Welfare Effects of Congestion Pricing and Transit Services in Multiclass Multimodal Networks
> This paper analyzes the welfare effects of congestion pricing with the use of a general bimodal network with heterogeneous users. Transit service is modeled as a cheaper (because of its lower operating cost) and undesirable (because of the relatively long travel time) alternative to the highway network and is added to an origin destination pair as an exclusive link. The analysis characterizes the critical users those who suffer the greatest loss from pricing as those who experience the least change in travel time after pricing. Accordingly, the paper shows that critical users could be rich, poor, or middle class, depending on their origin and destination. This finding highlights the spatial heterogeneity of distributional effects. Furthermore, numerical experiments indicate that (a) those with a low value of time tend to benefit more from greater coverage of transit services than those with intermediate values of time; (b) in the presence of poor transit coverage, users with access to transit may share a disproportionally greater burden for the congestion relief generated by an optimum toll for the system; and (c) the optimum toll for the system generally leads to a welfare gap between the rich and the poor larger than those of toll schemes that have proportionally lower magnitudes and achieve smaller efficiency improvements.
### 227. Integrated Analysis of Toll Lanes and Bus Priority Lanes
> Although toll lanes may generate net benefits, their political acceptability is problematic, especially for vertical equity among income classes. A strategy is presented for gaining acceptability for a toll lane in a congested corridor through a lane allocation approach, which integrates toll and bus lanes along the corridor. A bimodal equilibrium concept is illustrated for the lane allocation scheme for bus and toll lanes. A travel demand model is designed to determine traveler reactions to such lane allocation. With link cost functions specialized by several link groups, the demand model uses the multiclass, multicriteria network equilibrium model in the multimodal network with elastic demand. To address simultaneously the political and economic issues arising from toll and bus lanes in a network, a multiobjective decision-making model supports the lane allocation model. An equity measure based on travel time variations among user groups is incorporated in the decision model and an internal toll-funding scheme is developed to consider revenue allocation. The toll funding can increase available financial resources and may serve most users whose travel is affected by the toll lane. An example analysis indicates that an effective integration strategy of toll and bus lanes and a toll-funding scheme can enhance public acceptability of toll lanes and produces synergistic benefits.
### 228. Evidence-Based Transit and Land Use Sketch Planning Using Interactive Accessibility Methods on Combined Schedule and Headway-Based Networks
> There is a need for indicators of transportation-land use system quality that are understandable to a wide range of stakeholders and that can provide immediate feedback on the quality of interactively designed scenarios. Location-based accessibility indicators are promising candidates, but indicator values can vary strongly depending on time of day and transfer wait times. Capturing this variation increases complexity, slowing calculations. This paper presents new methods for rapid yet rigorous computation of accessibility metrics, allowing immediate feedback during early-stage transit planning while being rigorous enough for final analyses. The approach is statistical, characterizing the uncertainty and variability in accessibility metrics related to differences in departure time and headway-based scenario specification. The analysis was carried out on a detailed multimodal network model including both public transportation and streets. Land use data were represented at high resolution. These methods were implemented as open-source software running on a commodity cloud infrastructure. Networks were constructed from standard open data sources, and scenarios were built in a map-based web interface. A case study is presented, describing how these methods were applied in a long-term transportation planning process for an urbanized, polycentric Randstad region in the Netherlands.
### 229. A review of fleet planning problems in single and multimodal transportation systems
> This paper mainly evaluates the previously published fleet planning researches which primarily utilize operations research and computational intelligence based techniques. An intermodal fleet planning framework with a classification scheme is also proposed by considering different problem/modeling characteristics, decision-making levels and multiple players or decision makers. Majority of the papers in this field generally focused on single mode fleet planning problems from the viewpoint of a single decision maker. However, there is a limited number of studies on intermodal fleet planning with multiple transport modes and resources. On the other hand, there is a strong interaction among the fleet planning components such as fleet sizing/composition, fleet deployment, fleet inventory control, empty vehicle repositioning problems etc. Nevertheless, these problems are mostly modeled and solved in a separated way in the available literature. Evaluation of the previous fleet planning researches enabled us to identify gaps in the literature and comment on the directions for future works which can lead to develop expert systems/decision support systems in the context of Logistics 4.0 for the integrated fleet planning problems with sustainability objectives under uncertain environments.
### 230. A Hybrid Branch-and-Bound and Benders Decomposition Algorithm for the Network Design Problem
> Given a set of candidate road projects associated with costs, finding the best subset with respect to a limited budget is known as the network design problem (NDP). The NDP is often cast in a bilevel programming problem which is known to be NP-hard. In this study, we tackle a special case of the NDP where the decision variables are integers. A variety of exact solutions has been proposed for the discrete NDP, but due to the combinatorial complexity, the literature has yet to address the problem for large-size networks, and accounting for the multimodal and multiclass traffic flows. To this end, the bilevel problem is solved by branch-and-bound. At each node of the search tree, a valid lower bound based on system optimal (SO) traffic flow is calculated. The SO traffic flow is formulated as a mixed integer, non-linear programming (MINLP) problem for which the Benders decomposition method is used. The algorithm is coded on a hybrid and synchronized platform consisting of MATLAB (optimization engine), EMME 3 (transport planning module), MS Access (database), and MS Excel (user interface). The proposed methodology is applied to three examples including Gao's network, the Sioux-Falls network, and a real size network representing the city of Winnipeg, Canada. Numerical tests on the network of Winnipeg at various budget levels have shown promising results.
### 231. Intermodal transport in freight distribution: a literature review
> There has been significant growth in research on intermodal transport in freight distribution since the 1990s. Differentiating itself from previously published literature reviews, this paper evaluates the current state of this research using Systematic Literature Review methodology. The complementary aims are: (a) to identify the research lines developed and to propose a criterion for classifying the literature, and (b) to discuss the empirical evidence that identifies existing interrelationships. The analysis has enabled three main lines of research to be identified. The first research line, basic principles of intermodal transport, groups together works related to the definition of intermodal transport and the results obtained using this transportation system. The second, improvements to the way that intermodal transport systems work, frames elements and variables that impact intermodal transport systems' logistics efficiency, such as quality of service, information and communication systems, and freight planning and linkages among system operators to provide an adequate service. Finally, the third line, intermodal transport system modelling, identifies the main variables used to optimise these transport systems, the different focuses and approaches used in modelling, and the advantages and disadvantages of each focus. These research lines take in more specific sublines that incorporate articles that develop related research questions. Lastly, the discussion of the content of each of these research sublines enables us to identify gaps in the literature and comment on directions for future research.
### 232. Transit path-choice models that use revealed preference and stated preference data
> A study was conducted of the trip-making behavior of transit users in a complex transit network with input of travel information in an increasingly complex and information-rich transit environment. A modeling framework to assess the preferences of commuters toward a range of factors and alternatives was produced. Path-choice models on transit services of Singapore were developed using mixed revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) data. RP models were estimated using data obtained in the 1997 Household Interview Survey. An SP survey based on,44 scenarios was conducted, which yielded 307 responses at 12 different locations in Singapore. Models based on pure RP data, pure SP data, and mixed RP and SP data were estimated. For transit users, the decision of which path to take relies on the trade-offs among attributes of journey time and other factors. The significant attributes in the models indicate that the transit path choice is a multi-criteria decision-making process. This suggests that the usual way of transit path assignment in many planning models based on single criterion, such as minimum time, may not be appropriate in choice situations. Path-choice models developed and calibrated provide important fundamental knowledge of the way transit services are, to be utilized by travelers, for use in a wide range of applications, such as multimodal transit service planning models, transit demand modeling, and integration of the transit path-choice models in intelligent transportation systems applications.
### 233. MODELING MULTIMODAL MORNING COMMUTE IN A ONE-TO-ONE CORRIDOR NETWORK
> In this paper, we address the morning commute problem with three modes: transit, diving alone and carpool. The transit mode uses its own separate guideway, but the auto modes can access two parallel routes to reach the destination --- a freeway and an arterial road (AR). Moreover, carpoolers are assumed to share their fuel costs and road tolls, if there is any, in addition to their advantage of using specially provided lanes (HOV lanes). However, there is an added cost of carpool: the cost of gathering together. We studied the interactions among the three modes and how different factors affect their mode share and network performances. This was achieved by first deriving the departure time equilibrium for the transit mode (in the same fashion as is done for the auto modes), then establishing equilibrium within each mode. The shares among the modes, the mode split, are determined by a nested logit model. Our analytical and numerical results indicate that carpoolers always choose the freeway when carpool offers sufficient travel cost advantage over solo-driving. When HOV lanes no longer offer carpoolers the travel advantage, they are more likely to use the AR than solo drivers. But when a uniform toll is applied, Carpoolers would use the freeway more than solo-drivers because they can share the toll, and this leads to reduced total travel cost. When traffic demand is sufficiently high, adding more HOV lanes and hence the overall capacity of the freeway can entice significantly higher auto traffic and lower transit ridership. When the total capacity of the freeway is fixed but the share of the HOV capacity increases, transit ridership would increase slightly, and carpoolers shift from the AR to the freeway, and solo drivers from freeway to the AR. In addition, these modal shifts may not necessarily reduce the total travel cost of the network. The rise of gas price may entice auto commuters to carpool first. However, as the price increases further, more of them would use transit. In addition, under heavy demand expanding freeway capacity is more effective in reducing total travel cost than expanding the capacity of the AR. Finally, a time-varying toll is shown to completely eliminate congestion on the freeway.
### 234. A Big Data Demand Estimation Framework for Multimodal Modelling of Urban Congested Networks
> This paper deals with the problem of estimating daily mobility flows using different sources of data, and in particular from mobile devices, such as mobile phones and floating car data. We show how mobile phone data can be used to better estimate the structure of the demand matrix, both temporally (i.e. the daily generated flows from each zone) and spatially (i.e. distributing the flows on the different OD pairs). Then, floating car data together with traffic counts can be used to further distribute the demand on the available modes and routes. During this phase, a behavioral modelling approach is used, according to traditional dynamic user equilibrium using a joint route and departure time choice model. Floating car data information is used to estimate speed profiles at all links where information is available, and for route travel times, which feed the utility-based models. A two-step approach is then proposed to solve the problem for large scale networks, in which the total demand is first generated, and then equilibrium is calculated through a dynamic traffic assignment model. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed modelling framework is shown on a realistic case study involving the road network of Luxembourg City and its surroundings, and is compared to the traditional bi-level formulation solved using the Generalized Least Square (GLS) Estimation. The comparison shows how the two-step approach is more robust in generating realistic daily OD flows, and in exploiting the information collected from mobile sensors.
### 235. Accounting for travel time variability in the optimal pricing of cars and buses
> A number of studies have shown that in addition to travel time and cost as the common influences on mode, route and departure time choices, travel time variability plays an increasingly important role, especially in the presence of traffic congestion on roads and crowding on public transport. The dominant focus of modelling and implementation of optimal pricing that incorporates trip time variability has been in the context of road pricing for cars. The main objective of this paper is to introduce a non-trivial extension to the existing literature on optimal pricing in a multimodal setting, building in the role of travel time variability as a source of disutility for car and bus users. We estimate the effect of variability in travel time and bus headway on optimal prices (i.e., tolls for cars and fares for buses) and optimal bus capacity (i.e., frequencies and size) accounting for crowding on buses, under a social welfare maximisation framework. Travel time variability is included by adopting the well-known mean-variance model, using an empirical relationship between the mean and standard deviation of travel times. We illustrate our model with an application to a highly congested corridor with cars, buses and walking as travel alternatives in Sydney, Australia. There are three main findings that have immediate policy implications: (i) including travel time variability results in higher optimal car tolls and substantial increases in toll revenue, while optimal bus fares remain almost unchanged; (ii) when bus headways are variable, the inclusion of travel time variability as a source of disutility for users yields higher optimal bus frequencies; and (iii) including both travel time variability and crowding discomfort leads to higher optimal bus sizes.
### 236. Assessing the impacts of automated mobility-on-demand through agent-based simulation: A study of Singapore
> The advent of autonomous vehicle technologies and the emergence of new ride-sourcing business models has spurred interest in Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMOD) as a prospective solution to meet the challenges of urbanization. AMOD has the potential of providing a convenient, reliable and affordable mobility service through more competitive cost structures enabled by autonomy (relative to existing services) and more efficient centralized fleet operations. However, the short and medium-term impacts of AMOD are as yet uncertain. On the one hand, it has the potential to alleviate congestion through increased ride-sharing and reduced car-ownership, and by complementing mass-transit. Conversely, AMOD may in fact worsen congestion due to induced demand, the cannibalization of public transit shares, and an increase in Vehicle-Kilometers Traveled (VKT) because of rebalancing and empty trips. This study attempts to systematically examine the impacts of AMOD on transportation in Singapore through agent-based simulation, modeling demand, supply and their interactions explicitly. On the demand side, we utilize an activity-based model system, that draws on data from a smartphone-based stated preferences survey conducted in Singapore. On the supply side, we model the operations of the AMOD fleet (including the assignment of requests to vehicles and rebalancing), which are integrated within a multimodal mesoscopic traffic simulator. Comprehensive simulations are conducted using a model of Singapore for the year 2030 and yield insights into the impacts of AMOD in dense transit-dependent cities from the perspective of the transportation planner, fleet operator, and user. The findings suggest that an unregulated introduction of AMOD can cause significant increases in network congestion and VKT, and have important policy implications that could potentially inform future deployments of AMOD.
### 237. Bayesian network-based formulation and analysis for toll road utilization supported by traffic information provision
> Congestion pricing has been proposed and investigated as an effective means of optimizing traffic assignment, alleviating congestion, and enhancing traffic operation efficiencies. Meanwhile, advanced traffic information dissemination systems, such as Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS), have been developed and deployed to provide real-time, accurate, and complete network-wide traffic information to facilitate travelers' trip plans and routing selections. Recent advances in ATIS technologies, especially telecommunication technology, allow dynamic, personalized, and multimodal traffic information to be disseminated and impact travelers' choices of departure times, alternative routes, and travel modes in the context of congestion pricing. However, few studies were conducted to determine the impact of traffic information dissemination on toll road utilizations. In this study, the effects of the provisions of traffic information on toll road usage are investigated and analyzed based on a stated preference survey conducted in Texas. A Bayesian Network (BN)-based approach is developed to discover travelers' opinions and preferences for toll road utilization supported by network-wide traffic information provisions. The probabilistic interdependencies among various attributes, including routing choice, departure time, traffic information dissemination mode, content, coverage, commuter demographic information, and travel patterns, are identified and their impacts on toll road usage are quantified. The results indicate that the BN model performs reasonably well in travelers' preference classifications for toll road utilization and knowledge extraction. The BN Most Probable Explanation (MPE) measurement, probability inference and variable influence analysis results illustrate travelers using highway advisory radio and internet as their primary mode of receiving traffic information are more likely to comply with routing recommendations and use toll roads. Traffic information regarding congested roads, road hazard warnings, and accident locations is of great interest to travelers, who tend to acquire such information and use toll roads more frequently. Travel time formation for home-based trips can considerably enhance travelers' preferences for toll road usage. Female travelers tend to seek traffic information and utilize toll roads more frequently. As expected, the information provided at both pre-trip and en-route stages can positively influence travelers' preferences for toll road usage. The proposed methodology and research findings advance our previous study and provide insight into travelers' behavioral tendencies concerning toll road utilization in support of traffic information dissemination.

### 238. The development of integrated land use-transport models in Oregon
> The Oregon DOT has embarked upon a transportation and land use model integration program, designed to build a set of consistent and scalable analysis tools for studying the interaction of land use, transportation, and the environment. These models, which will operate at different spatial scales, are integrated models of land use and transportation. That is, they use consistent models of location and activity choice, as opposed to linked models of transportation and land use. Discrete choice and random utility concepts are employed throughout the model. While employed elsewhere in the world, models of this nature have only recently been attempted in the United;States. The models described are aggregate models implemented in TRANUS, and are the first of their kind to be applied at the statewide and regional levels in North America. This paper focuses upon a statewide land use-transport model for Oregon, which has been recently implemented. It focuses primarily on intercity tripmaking, and takes into account the economic interaction between places within Oregon. The market for land is represented by demand functions for several categories of households, businesses, and public uses. These socioeconomic sectors interact through a social accounting matrix, which is an extension of the regional input-output model formulation. The paper describes the collection of the data required to implement the model, as well as their role in model estimation. The activity location and interaction component of the model is expressed in terms of production and consumption. Each sector in the model interacts with others through logit-based demand functions that vary as a function of production and transport costs. The spatial relationships are expressed in terms of flows between both sectors and zones. The structure of the activity location model are described in general terms, as well as the derivation of input-output flows for Oregon. The activity flows are transformed into flows of persons and goods in an interface module. Data from passenger and freight surveys are used to convert activity flows (measured in dollars, acres, or employment) into daily vehicle and truckload equivalents. Trip matrices are generated for specific trip purposes, which are then assigned to a multimodal, multicommodity transportation network. A stochastic equilibrium assignment model is used to depict network flows and to calculate travel costs and measures of accessibility. These costs and disutilities are then fed back to the activity location model until convergence is reached. The final network costs influence activity location and interaction in the following time period, The model was calibrated to 1990-1995 data, and uses 5-year intervals for forecasts through 2025. The resulting model can be used to examine a variety of transportation and land use policy actions and their interactions through time. The integrated structure of the model ensures that effects are consistently reflected in both the activity and destination choice models. The paper concludes with a discussion of the extension of the statewide model to the substate level in Oregon, integration with metropolitan models within the state, and ongoing research and development of both models.
