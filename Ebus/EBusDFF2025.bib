abstract = {Sequential planning of public transportation services can lead to inefficient vehicle schedules. Integrating timetabling and vehicle scheduling, the vehicle scheduling problem with time windows (VSP-TW) aims at minimizing costs of public transport operations by allowing small shifts of service trips' departure times. Within the scope of tactical planning, a larger flexibility of departure times following predefined departure time windows may be desirable. However, with increasing degrees of freedom, conventional solution approaches for the VSP-TW become computationally prohibitive. Furthermore, a sole focus on cost minimization might produce timetables of insufficient quality, while public transport agencies expect high-quality timetables with service trips scheduled at times reasonable from a passenger's point of view. Extending the VSP-TW, we propose the vehicle scheduling problem with time windows and balanced departure times (VSP-TW-BT). In addition to the cost-efficiency objective of the VSP-TW, our objective function considers the quality of a timetable from a passenger's point of view. Timetables are generated by balancing consecutive departures on a line according to predefined departure time intervals. We use a weighted sum approach to combine both objectives, namely costs of operation and quality of timetables. Our mathematical model and solution approach are based on efficient techniques known from the area of vehicle routing with time windows. A hybrid metaheuristic framework is proposed, which decomposes the problem into a scheduling and a balancing component. Real-world-inspired instances allow for the evaluation of quality and performance of the solution approach. The proposed solution approach is able to outperform a commercial solver in terms of run time and solution quality.},

For each of these planning stages, models are known and advanced solution techniques exist. Some of the models focus on costs, others on passengers' convenience. Setting up a transportation system is usually done by optimizing each of these stages sequentially. In this paper we argue that instead of optimizing each single step further and further it would be more beneficial to consider the whole process in an integrated way. To this end, we develop and discuss a generic, bi-objective model for integrating line planning, timetabling, and vehicle scheduling. We furthermore propose an eigenmodel which we apply for these three planning stages and show how it can be used for the design of iterative algorithms as heuristics for the integrated problem. The convergence of the resulting iterative approaches is analyzed from a theoretical point of view. Moreover, we propose an agenda for further research in this field.},

abstract = {The deployment of battery-powered electric bus systems within the public transportation sector plays an important role in increasing energy efficiency and abating emissions. Rising attention is given to bus systems using fast charging technology. This concept requires a comprehensive infrastructure to equip bus routes with charging stations. The combination of charging infrastructure and bus batteries needs a reliable energy supply to maintain a stable bus operation even under demanding conditions. An efficient layout of the charging infrastructure and an appropriate dimensioning of battery capacity are crucial to minimize the total cost of ownership and to enable an energetically feasible bus operation. In this work, the central issue of jointly optimizing the charging infrastructure and battery capacity is described by a capacitated set covering problem. A mixed-integer linear optimization model is developed to determine the minimum number and location of required charging stations for a bus network as well as the adequate battery capacity for each bus line. The bus energy consumption for each route segment is determined based on individual route, bus type, traffic, and other information. Different scenarios are examined in order to assess the influence of charging power, climate, and changing operating conditions. The findings reveal significant differences in terms of required infrastructure. Moreover, the results highlight a trade-off between battery capacity and charging infrastructure under different operational and infrastructure conditions. This paper addresses upcoming challenges for transport authorities during the electrification process of the bus fleets and sharpens the focus on infrastructural issues related to the fast charging concept.},

We consider an electrified transportation network enabled by wireless power transfer technology and coupled with a power distribution network (PDN) in the future city. The independent system operator, which is a public entity, is eligible to manage generation assets and charge congestion tolls (CTs) on electrified roads with the purpose of minimizing social cost. The route choices of electric vehicles are amenable to the Wardrop user equilibrium (UE) principle, such that no one can reduce his travel cost by changing route unilaterally. The traffic UE pattern further influences the spatial distribution of the electrical loads of the PDN. The power flow of the PDN is modeled through Dist-Flow equations. To find out the best generation schedule and CTs, we propose an optimal traffic-power flow model, which is a mixed integer nonlinear program with traffic UE constraints and further reformulated as a mixed integer second-order cone program, whose global optimal solution is accessible with reasonable computation effort. Case studies corroborate the benefits from the joint operation of the coupled networks, and demonstrate that ignoring the interdependency between the two critical infrastructures may lead to an insecure operation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model-based multiobjective control strategy to reduce bus bunching and hence improve public transport reliability. Our goal is twofold. First, we define a proper model, consisting of multiple static and dynamic components. Bus-following model captures the longitudinal dynamics taking into account the interaction with the surrounding traffic. Furthermore, bus stop operations are modeled to estimate dwell time. Second, a shrinking horizon model predictive controller (MPC) is proposed for solving bus bunching problems. The model is able to predict short time-space behavior of public transport buses enabling constrained, finite horizon, optimal control solution to ensure homogeneity of service both in time and space. In this line, the goal with the selected rolling horizon control scheme is to choose a proper velocity profile for the public transport bus such that it keeps both timetable schedule and a desired headway from the bus in front of it (leading bus). The control strategy predicts the arrival time at a bus stop using a passenger arrival and dwell time model. In this vein, the receding horizon model predictive controller calculates an optimal velocity profile based on its current position and desired arrival time. Four different weighting strategies are proposed to test (i) timetable only, (ii) headway only, (iii) balanced timetable - headway tracking and (iv) adaptive control with varying weights. The controller is tested in a high fidelity traffic simulator with realistic scenarios. The behavior of the system is analyzed by considering extreme disturbances. Finally, the existence of a Pareto front between these two objectives is also demonstrated.},

We then conduct an empirical analysis utilizing available real-world data. The results suggest that: (1) the service frequency, circulation length, and operating speed of a transit system may have a great impact on the cost competitiveness of different charging infrastructure; (2) charging lanes enabled by currently available inductive wireless charging technology are cost competitive for most of the existing bus rapid transit corridors; (3) swapping stations can yield a lower total cost than charging lanes and charging stations for transit systems with high operating speed and low service frequency; (4) charging stations are cost competitive only for transit systems with very low service frequency and short circulation; and (5) the key to making charging lanes more competitive for transit systems with low service frequency and high operating speed is to reduce their unit-length construction cost or enhance their charging power.},

Worldwide, carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion rose by 49% between 1990 and 2011. Moreover, urban mobility is set to double by 2025. Public transport consumes 3.4 times less energy per passenger kilometer than automobiles. Therefore, an increase in the share of public transport and a technological shift are key to meet EU 2050 objective to decarbonize the transport sector. In a Well-to-Wheels perspective, electric vehicles emit less nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter than internal combustion engine vehicles. Thus, promotion of electric buses in public transit fleets is highly valued. Multiple factors must be considered to achieve both objectives of low cost and energy efficiency. Electric bus performance depends on driving distance, road orography... recharging infrastructure depends on number/length of bus stops, electric grid characteristics and electric tariffs. On-board batteries must adapt to demanding cycling profiles that can severely impact their performance and lifespan. New battery technologies allow for improved electric buses design and recharging strategies. However, technical information about the relationship between battery technologies and electric bus performance is limited. In this paper, strengths and weaknesses of different batteries and charging technologies are presented when used in battery electric buses projects implemented in European. Lessons learned may help to redesign European public transport.},

From a system-level perspective, on-road fast charging stations would simultaneously impact vehicle routing in the transportation system and load flows in the distribution system, therefore tightly couple the two systems. In this paper, a dedicated traffic user equilibrium model is proposed to describe the steady-state distribution of traffic flows comprised of gasoline vehicles and electric vehicles. It encapsulates route selections, charging opportunities, electricity prices, and individual rationalities of minimum travel expense in a convex traffic assignment problem over an extended transportation network. An adaptive path generation oracle is suggested to solve the problem in a tractable manner. Economic operation of the power distribution system is formulated as an alternating current optimal power flow problem. Convex relaxation is performed. The optimal generation dispatch and nodal electricity prices can be computed from a second-order cone program. It is revealed that an equilibrium state will emerge due to the rational behaviors in the coupled systems, which is characterized via a fixed-point problem. A best-response decomposition algorithm is suggested to identify the network equilibrium through iteratively solving the traffic assignment problem and the optimal power flow problem, both of which entail convex optimization.

abstract = {This study deals with the bus & driver scheduling problems with mealtime windows for a single public transport bus route. Firstly, we develop three explicit Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models to formulate: the bus driver scheduling, bus & driver scheduling, and bus & driver scheduling with mealtime windows, respectively. These ILP models enable bus operators to solve their bus & driver scheduling problems by directly invoking an available optimization solver such as IBM ILOG CPLEX. However, our numerical experiments do not show remarkable improvements, as CPLEX takes more than 12, 17, and 35 h respectively to reduce the optimality gap to at most 0.5% for solving the above three models in an over 12-hour bus & driver scheduling problem. To improve the computational efficiency, we develop a valid inequality approach that can generate valid cuts incorporating with the CPLEX. An investigation into the valid inequality approach proves its high computational efficiency. In addition, we develop a self-adaptive search method for determining the upper and lower bounds of driver group and bus fleet sizes. Finally, we test our models and approaches on a real round-trip bus route. The results indicate that compared with the only use of CPLEX to solve the above three models, the valid inequality approach can address large-scale instances in a reasonable CPU time.},

Such transitions are often established by fleet electrification targets, which dictate the number of electric buses that should be in the fleet by a given time period. In this paper we introduce a comprehensive optimization-based decision making tool to support such transitions. More precisely, we present a fleet replacement problem which allows organizations to determine bus replacement plans that will meet their fleet electrification targets in a cost-effective way, namely considering purchase costs, salvage revenues, operating costs, charging infrastructure investments, and demand charges. We account for several charging infrastructure options, such as slow and fast plug-in stations, overhead pantograph chargers, and inductive (wireless) chargers. We refer to this problem as the electric bus fleet transition problem, and we model it as an integer linear program.

abstract = {This paper develops a formulation for the multiple depot (MD)vehicle scheduling problem with multiple vehicle types (MVT), including electric buses (EBs), under range and refueling constraints. A novel approach is developed to generate the feasible time-space-energy (TSE)network for bus flow and time-space (TS)network for passenger flow, where the range and refueling issues can be precisely addressed. We then introduce the external cost associated with emissions, and investigate the minimum total system cost to operators and passengers by scheduling the bus fleet and locating the refueling stations. The problem is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP)to find the global optimal solution. For computational efficiency, we develop a simplified formulation based on the TS bus flow network to handle larger-scale problems for approximate solutions. We apply the methods to bus services in Hong Kong to analyze the bus fleet size needed, operational cost, passenger cost, and emissions generated by buses with multiple energy sources. Through the formulation, we study the implications of government subsidy for EBs, bus scheduling in Low Emission Zone (LEZ), and safe driving ratio design for bus refueling.},

abstract = {Planning a public transportation system is a complex process, which is usually broken down in several phases, performed in sequence. Most often, the trips required to cover a service with the desired frequency (headway) are decided early on, while the vehicles needed to cover these trips are determined at a later stage. This potentially leads to requiring a larger number of vehicles (and, therefore, drivers) that would be possible if the two decisions were performed simultaneously. We propose a multicommodity-flow type model for integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling. Since the model is large-scale and cannot be solved by off-the-shelf tools with the efficiency required by planners, we propose a diving-type matheuristic approach for the problem. We report on the efficiency and effectiveness of two variants of the proposed approach, differing on how the continuous relaxation of the problem is solved, to tackle real-world instances of bus transport planning problem originating from customers of M.A.I.O.R., a leading company providing services and advanced decision-support systems to public transport authorities and operators. The results show that the approach can be used to aid even experienced planners in either obtaining better solutions, or obtaining them faster and with less effort, or both.},

From this point of view, the city of Hamburg is planning the conversion to emission free buses. Both bus companies in Hamburg; the Hamburger HOCHBAHN AG and Verkehrsbetriebe Hamburg-Holstein GmbH (VHH) estimated to buy 1500 electric buses by 2030. This conversion represents a challenge for the electrical grid due to the increase of the electrical demand. The typical daily timeline for bus routes of the bus depot in Alsterdorf in the city of Hamburg is considered in this paper. This enabled the authors to calculate the daily load profile of this bus depot. Moreover, the authors could identify different potentials to optimize the whole load profile. In order to decrease the peak load, this paper is introducing two new possibilities for the load distribution over the available charging slots; preemptive and quasi-preemptive greedy algorithms. Furthermore, the results of implementing those two possibilities will be compared with the results of implementing a non-preemptive method.},

abstract = {Because of zero emissions and other social and economic benefits, electric vehicles (EVs) are currently being introduced in more and more transit agencies around the world. One of the most challenging tasks involves efficiently scheduling a set of EVs considering the limited driving range and charging requirement constraints. This study examines the battery-electric transit vehicle scheduling problem (BET-VSP) with stationary battery chargers installed at transit terminal stations. Two equivalent versions of mathematical formulations of the problem are provided. The first formulation is based on the deficit function theory, and the second formulation is an equivalent bi-objective integer programming model. The first objective of the math-programming optimization is to minimize the total number of EVs required, while the second objective is to minimize the total number of battery chargers required. To solve this bi-objective BET-VSP, two solution methods are developed. First, a lexicographic method-based two-stage construction-and-optimization solution procedure is proposed. Second, an adjusted max-flow solution method is developed. Three numerical examples are used as an expository device to illustrate the solution methods, together with a real-life case study in Singapore. The results demonstrate that the proposed math-programming models and solution methods are effective and have the potential to be applied in solving large-scale real-world BET-VSPs.},

Due to limited battery capacities, and to random battery discharge rates—which are affected by weather, road and traffic conditions—BEBs often need daytime charging to support their operation for a whole day. The deployment of charging infrastructures, as well as the number of stand-by buses available, has a significant effect on the operational efficiency of electric bus systems. In this work, a stochastic integer program has been developed to jointly optimise charging station locations and bus fleet size under random bus charging demand, considering time-of-use electricity tariffs. The stochastic program is first approximated by its sample average and is solved by a customised Lagrangian relaxation approach. The applicability of the model and solution algorithm is demonstrated by applications to a series of hypothetical grid networks and to a real-world Melbourne City bus network.

The proposed model co-optimizes the timing and location of BEBs' charging in the transit system with the operation of the power distribution system, while respecting the operational constraints and requirements of both power distribution and public transit systems. In the proposed model, the BEBs transit system is mathematically modeled by a graph and the associated BEB charging stations are mapped into the power distribution nodes. The BEBs' transit schedule constrains the spatio-temporal charging opportunities to all BEBs over the scheduling horizon. The proposed model is implemented on the IEEE 33-bus power distribution system coupled with the transit system of Park City, UT, USA, with BEB routes.

This paper studies the effect of charging EBs in a bus station in the power load, and proposes a new methodology considering EB aggregators to minimize electricity costs while meeting grid constraints.

Our model considers a social planner, such that the transit authority and the operator of the electricity system co-optimize the power system to minimize the total operational cost of the grid, while satisfying additional transportation constraints on buses. We provide deterministic and stochastic formulations to co-optimize the system. Each stochastic formulation provides a different set of recourse actions to manage the variable renewable energy uncertainty: ramping up/down the conventional generators, or charging/discharging of the transit fleet. We demonstrate the capabilities of the model and the benefit obtained via a coordinated strategy. We compare the efficacies of these recourse actions to provide additional managerial insights. We analyze the effect of different pricing strategies on the co-optimization. We also conduct congestion analysis in the power network, comparing our cooperative approach to a non-cooperative strategy when we assume electrified fleet sizes grow with greater battery capacities. Given the recent momentum towards building smarter cities and electrifying transit systems, our results provide policy directions towards a sustainable future. We test our models using modified MATPOWER case files and verify our results with different sized power networks. This study is motivated by a project with a large transit authority in California.},

This paper proposes a new methodology for the electric vehicle scheduling problem with multiple vehicle types (MVT-E-VSP) in public transport based on a given multi-vehicle-type timetable. First, with explicit consideration of differences in driving range, recharging duration and energy consumption of EBs for multiple vehicle types, an optimization model is established to minimize annual total scheduling costs, including the purchase costs of EBs and chargers, the operating costs of deadheading and timetabled trips, etc. Then, a heuristic procedure is developed to find the optimal solution considering recharging trips and the substitution between electric vehicle (EV) types. Finally, the proposed methodology is validated using a real-world transit network in Daxing District, Beijing. The optimization result provides transit agencies with guidance on the purchase and schedule of EBs for multiple vehicle types, as well as the deployment of chargers. Comparative analysis indicates the proposed method considering the substitution between EV types reduces annual total scheduling costs by 15.93% compared with the conventional method. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the current recharging power (240 kW) and discharging depth (80%) are approximately economical.},

This paper proposes an optimization model for joint post-disaster DS restoration, considering coordinated dispatching with EBs. By assuming that the DS can rent some EBs from the bus company, an EB scheduling problem with adjustable timetables is established. Idle buses are placed at designated areas and feed power back to the grid via charging piles or charging stations in case of need. The schedule of the remaining buses should meet the passenger transport demand, which is smaller than usual because of bad weather. The objective is to maximize the total benefits and minimize the EB rental cost of the grid company. Techniques in integer algebra are used to reformulate the proposed restoration problem with bus scheduling constraints as a mixed-integer linear program, which can be processed by off-the-shelf solvers. The proposed method is tested on a modified 15-bus system and IEEE 123-bus system. The results demonstrate that the resilience of the system is enhanced, and the benefits of the grid company increase significantly, because of the flexibility brought by EBs.},

abstract = {This study deals with a fundamental electric bus charging scheduling (EBCS) problem for a single public transport route by considering the nonlinear electric bus (EB) charging profile and battery degradation effect under the partial charging policy, which allows EBs to be charged any length of time and make good use of dwell times between consecutive trips. Given a group of trip tasks for an EB fleet and charger type, the problem is to minimize the total cost for a public transport operator of providing peak-hour bus services for a focal single public transport route by simultaneously determining the EB-to-trip assignment and EB charging schedule with charger type choice subject to the necessary EB operational constraints. We first build a mixed-integer nonlinear and nonconvex programming (MINL&NCP) model for the EBCS problem. To effectively solve the MINL&NCP model to global optimality, we subsequently develop two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models by means of linearization and approximation techniques. To accelerate the solution efficiency, we further create three families of valid inequalities depending on the unique features of the problem. A real case study based on the No.171 bus route in Singapore is conducted to demonstrate the performance of the developed models. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to seek valuable managerial insights for public transport operators.},

abstract = {One goal of future transit-oriented transportation systems is to promote door-to-door mobility for travelers by integrating different public transportation modes into a whole. We propose a mathematical design framework for such a transit-oriented multi-modal transportation system from a societal aspect considering three categories of public transportation modes, i.e., general on-demand modes, local on-demand modes, and fixed-schedule modes. A system-state equilibrium is brought up to describe travelers' rational travel choices and their reverse effects on agency service levels using the continuous approximation method, and a centralized system designer then manages to achieve a system-beneficial outcome with the minimum cost. To solve the design problem, we prove that the transportation system reaches a unique equilibrium when decision variables are given. By this discovery, we construct a global search framework based on the DIRECT algorithm to solve the optimal design. In analyzing the problem property, we rigorously prove that in the designed systems, the bus service as a fixed-schedule mode is absent from the design scheme under the cases with sufficiently low demands, and the design problem thus reduces to a one-dimensional line search. The ride-hailing service as a general on-demand mode is similarly proved to be excluded when the demand is sufficiently high. In this context, the approximate design parameters of the bus service and the total system cost are developed analytically. The local on-demand mode, bike-sharing service, as an option of bus feeders, is proved to be efficient under a realistic setting. Extensive numerical examples provide evidence verifying the preceding analyses and indicating the behavior of travelers and agencies. Further sensitivity tests show that the subway is favorable for intensive demands and autonomous vehicles may promote the ride-hailing industry. For completeness, an immediate application of the proposed framework in generalized cases validates the model reliability.},

abstract = {The present work refers to two current problems in the context of achieving Greenhouse gas (GHG) neutrality: first the curtailment of renewable, volatile power generation units and secondly the high share of the mobility domain in total GHG-emissions. Both problems can be countered by a decentralised, smart energy system that supplies electricity, gas and heat to a hybrid public transport bus fleet and is simultaneously coupled to the public gas grid, public electricity grid and the district heating grid (Multi-Grid-Coupling). The enabling energy conversion unit is a reversible solid oxide cell (rSOC), which is operated in combined heat and power (CHP) mode or in power-to-gas (P2G) mode. P2G is primarily a solution approach for the first-mentioned problem and can thus successively lead to the replacement of fossil energy sources. Furthermore, by integrating industrial waste gases – as a necessary CO2 source for the P2G process – an additional benefit is gained from the CO2 that is emitted anyhow. The hybrid bus fleet constitutes an ecological alternative concept in public transport and therefore addresses the second-mentioned problem. The system, developed under the current state of the art technologies and the current ecological and economic conditions for Europe and Germany, can be operated profitably from the perspective of the system operator. This applies to the economically and ecologically optimised operating schedule of the controllable system elements such as the electrical, thermal and compressed gas storages, rSOC, compressor and the energy exchange with the public grids. To derive the optimal operating schedule of the cross-sectoral system, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is implemented and simulated under the current legal situation.},

Hence, the electrification of this sector is a crucial contributor to the mitigation of global warming. Recent studies suggest that electric vehicles will be economically paired with internal combustion engine vehicles in the near future. However, relying on private vehicle decarbonization only cannot deliver comprehensive space management efficiency solutions in urban environments. Therefore, it is essential to invest in the technological development and deployment of electric buses for public transportation, directly enhancing the quality of life in large cities. From this perspective, this review examines a wide range of scientific literature on electric bus research using science mapping methods and content analysis to support critical thinking unveiling the main research streams, methods, and gaps of the field. The analysis indicates that future research on electric buses will be mainly devoted to sustainability (encompassing economic, environmental and quality of service dimensions), energy management strategies, and fleet operation.},

abstract = {The increasing of electric vehicles (EVs) alleviates the faced environmental problems but brings challenges to the optimal operation of transportation network (TN) and distribution network (DN). However, the most of existing research works consider EV charging station assignment and navigation services in the TN separately from charging station power scheduling services in the DN. To overcome this research gap, this paper proposes a collaborative optimal routing and scheduling (CORS) method, providing optimal route to charging stations and designing optimized charging scheduling schemes for each EV. In the order of reporting, whenever an EV reports its charging demand, a CORS optimization model is built and solved so that a specific charging scheme is designed for that EV. Then, the TN and DN status is updated to guide the subsequent EVs operating. The proposed CORS integrates the real-time state of the TN and DN, and effects positive benefits in helping EVs to avoid traffic congestion, improving the utilization level of charging facilities and enhancing charging economy. The combined distributed biased min consensus algorithm and generalized benders decomposition algorithm are adopted to solve the complex nonlinear optimization problem. Through comparing with the existing methods, better effectiveness is verified by simulation results.},

In response, public bus transit (PBT) and utility grid operators are currently in need of developing analytical techniques that enable them to conduct tradeoff analyses for the many available options of BEBs, charging infrastructure, and their associated system impacts. To that end, this article proposes a systematic and effective technique for feasibility check and configuration design of electrified PBT fleets without the need for the sophisticated optimization toolbox and high performance computing. The configuration design aims at determining the number of BEBs and their on-board battery capacities to meet the PBT prespecified schedule under different sizes of chargers. The proposed model is tailored for BEBs designed to either boost their batteries on-route at intermediate bus stations using fast chargers (opportunity charging) or charge while parked at the depot (in-depot charging). The developed model is also utilized to generate the aggregated power demand profiles of electrified PBT fleets under different charging practices. Based on the generated power demand profile, a lifecycle cost analysis is conducted to compare BEB-based PBT options to their diesel counterparts.},

abstract = {Electrification of bus fleets in most cities is expected to rise due to its significant environmental benefits. However, electric buses have limited driving range and long recharging times. Additionally, electric buses require special charging infrastructure, which overall makes them less flexible than conventional diesel buses. Due to the limitations of the electric bus technologies, further adjustments have to be made to the current bus transport planning problems. The scheduling of electric vehicles is recognized as a fast-growing area of research. In this paper, we review 43 articles related to the electric bus technologies and give an overview of the different problems in the electric bus planning process (strategic, tactical and operational). The different problems are: 1) investment of electric bus fleet and charging infrastructure, 2) placement of charging infrastructure, 3) the electric vehicle scheduling problem (E-VSP) and 4) the charging scheduling problem. Given a set of timetabled trips and recharging stations, the E-VSP is concerned with finding a vehicle schedule that covers the trips and satisfies the driving range and recharging requirements of electric buses while minimizing operational cost. A detailed literature review of the constraints associated with the E-VSP and the solution approaches proposed to solve it is given. Rescheduling aspects or considerations of robustness for scheduling of electric vehicles is identified as a future area of research. Furthermore, integrated electric bus planning is considered as a crucial area of research and integrated approaches could further improve the efficiency of electric bus transport systems.},

abstract = {Environmental concerns and urban air pollution are major drivers for the transition from combustion engines to electric vehicles. To support a large-scale adoption of electric vehicles an efficient charging infrastructure roll-out is required. However, the optimal planning of charging stations is a non-trivial task, as it requires coordination between planning activities in the transportation and the power distribution network. Historically, the modeling of these two networks has been approached from different research areas and with the use of different methodologies. As a result, few papers embrace the combined problem to its full extent and the literature is highly scattered and represents different model perspectives and the targeting of many different objectives. In the paper, we present a systematic review of the literature that considers the combined investigation of transportation and distribution networks, with a focus on objectives, methodology and scope. It allows us to describe the current state of the art, to highlight research gaps and to propose directions for future work of the research community. The identified research gaps include, but are not limited to: 1) a general lack of integrated modeling approaches, 2) the need for increasingly detailed modeling of charging demand that accounts for randomness and variability in space and time rather than averages to support power grid planning, 3) the need to consider a mix of different types of charging options rather than only fast charging and 4) the need to shift from standard test networks and theoretical based planning approaches to large-scale and real-world case studies.},

abstract = {Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) are considerably integrated into cities worldwide. These buses have a strict schedule; thus, they could be charged in a very short time with a power level up to 600 kW. The high-power systems and short charging times imply special grid operation conditions that should be taken into account. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the influence of their charging infrastructure on the distribution system operation, especially near the charging point. This work presents two Use Cases (UCs) from two demos (Germany and the Netherlands) to investigate the impact of the slow and fast-chargers' integrations on the power grid and environment. Fast-chargers up to 350 kW based on pantograph technology and slow-chargers up to 50 kW based on Combined Charging System Type 2 (CCS2) are used on the BEB line route and in the depot, respectively. The charging of BEBs with these solutions is studied here to investigate their impact on the grid in terms of power quality. It was found that the voltage variations due to fast-chargers terminal remain much below the EN50160 standard limit values i.e., ±10%. The obtained maximum Total Harmonic Voltage Distortion (THDv) value is 2.7%, with an average value of 1.3%, which is below the limit value of 8%, as per the standard EN 50160. Similarly, the individual harmonic currents were measured. The maximum value of total harmonic current distortion (THDI) is around 25%, with an average value of 3% only. As the average value of THDI is quite low, the harmonic current pollution is not a big concern for the installation at this time.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, many public transport companies have launched pilot projects testing the operation of electric buses. The basic objective of these projects is to substitute diesel buses with electric buses within the companies' daily operations. Despite an extensive media coverage, the share of electric buses deployed still remains very small in practice. In this context, new challenges arise for a company's planning process due to the considerably shorter ranges of electric buses compared to traditional combustion engine buses and to the necessity to recharge their batteries at charging stations. Vehicle scheduling, an essential planning task within the planning process, is especially affected by these additional challenges. In this paper, we define the mixed fleet vehicle scheduling problem with electric vehicles. We extend the traditional vehicle scheduling problem by considering a mixed fleet consisting of electric buses with limited driving ranges and rechargeable batteries as well as traditional diesel buses without such range limitations. To solve the problem, we introduce a three-phase solution approach based on an aggregated time–space network consisting of an exact solution method for the vehicle scheduling problem without range limitations, innovative flow decomposition methods, and a novel algorithm for the consideration of charging procedures. Through a computational study using real-world bus timetables, we show that our solution approach meets the requirements of a first application of electric buses in practice. Since the employment of electric buses is mainly influenced by the availability of charging infrastructure, which is determined by the distribution of charging stations within the route network, we particularly focus on the influence of the charging infrastructure.},

To accurately model the interdependency between the power distribution network and the transportation network, a proper interface equation is proposed. Considering data privacy, we adopt a distributed optimization. Furthermore, we present a power allocation strategy based on model predictive control to meet the charging requirements of different EVs. Correspondingly, the above ideas form a two-layer optimization strategy. Based on the integrated pricing strategy, the upper layer aims to minimize the power generation cost and transportation travel cost, while balancing the load levels. The lower layer distributes charging power to different EVs based on the total power demand from the interface equation between the power distribution network and the transportation network. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated pricing strategy for coordinating load levels in coupled networks.},

abstract = {While the environmental advantages of battery-electric buses (BEBs) are well-known, their significant differences from diesel buses require alterations to both route design (i.e., charging station locations) and operations (i.e., schedule management and holding control). The location, number, charging duration, and types of charging stations must be considered as part of the planning process. Charging stations can be located at depots, termini, or en-route. This paper considers the long-term planning and optimization problem of en-route charging station locations and charging duration to optimize passengers' waiting time and operation and capital costs while addressing the weather-induced stochasticity of ridership and battery performance of the BEBs. A linear deterministic optimization model and a two-stage stochastic programming (SP) optimization process are developed to place BEB charging stations along the route and estimate their assigned charging time for both one-way and two-way operations. The developed approaches are tested on two high-demand bus routes in Calgary. The impact of the breakdown of the charging station associated with the maximum charging time on the schedule and the cost of the BEB operation is assessed. The solution of the stochastic model is analyzed using the expected value of perfect information as an index. The results indicate that using the SP model helps decrease the expected travel time of the route while the total cost per trip increases compared to the deterministic model.},

abstract = {Vehicle timetabling and scheduling in a public transit system are usually performed separately, with the output of timetabling serving as the input of scheduling. An obvious drawback of this sequential planning method is that the trade-off between bus timetables and vehicle schedules may be neglected when determining solutions, which in turn results in that the obtained solutions may be inferior to those produced using an integrated framework. For example, a well-planned timetable may result in a schedule that requires a large vehicle fleet size with more operational cost, while a well-planned schedule may reduce the quality of a bus timetable by limiting the use of vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a time-space network-based framework for integrating electric bus timetabling and scheduling, with minimum and maximum headway times, depot requirements, deadheading and vehicle battery capacities considerations. The underlying time-space network is constructed with well-designed inventory arcs that represent multiple operations a bus may execute, thus decreasing the network size. Using the constructed network, we formulate the considered problem with a multi-commodity network flow model and develop a Lagrangian relaxation heuristic that consists of three phases, including generating relaxed solutions, making relaxed solutions feasible, and improving feasible solutions, to solve the integrated model. Tests on a set of instances confirm that the proposed integrated solution method can efficiently produce bus timetables and schedules with valid bounds, indicate that the integrated method can produce better solutions where the profit is increased by 5.29%–20.28%, and show how the headway times, service trip profit and operating cost settings affect the solution.},

We investigate the feasibility of the novel “Bus-to-Grid” (B2G) or “E-Buses as Power Storage” (EBaPS) concept, which allows battery E-buses to provide transportation as well as power-grid services. By aggregating the electrified bus fleets into Virtual Power Plants and discharging the energy to the grid, a bus operator can provide grid services and open up a secondary revenue source in addition to fareboxes. We discuss two contracts the bus operator can arrange with the grid. The first one is “Sale by Market Price (SbMP)”, presuming that the buses can discharge and sell the energy at real-time market prices. The second one is “Frequency Control Reserve (FCR)”, in which the buses discharge on immediate requests of the grid. We formulate the two contracts and their associated fleet allocation problems as two non-linear optimization problems maximizing the operator's profit. Optimal bus charging, discharging, and dispatching plans are solved on an aggregate level for strategic planning, allowing scalability to large fleet sizes. The profitability of the contracts is illustrated based on the schedule and demand of a real bus line and observed time-of-day dependent price variations of the energy market.},

To realize the benefits of the transition to battery-electric buses (BEBs) while retaining acceptable quality of service and limiting capital costs, agencies must intelligently decide where to locate recharging infrastructure. While most agencies electrifying their fleets plan to install chargers at bases where buses are kept overnight, a question faced by many fleet operators is where to install layover chargers that provide additional energy while buses are in operation during the day. To address this challenge, this work presents a mixed-integer linear programming model, referred to as BEB-OCL (BEB Optimal Charger Location), that optimizes the tradeoff between upfront charging infrastructure costs and operational performance. The key decision variables include the locations at which to install chargers, the number of chargers installed at each chosen location, and the location, duration, and sequence of charger visits for each bus. We also introduce a second optimization model, referred to as BEB-BRP (BEB Block Revision Problem), that revises vehicle schedules by dispatching backup buses to serve some trips so that buses do not run out of battery and all passenger trips are still completed as scheduled. The models are applied to a case study of the highest-ridership bus routes in King County, WA, USA, where an electric bus deployment is currently underway.},

abstract = {In a battery electric bus (BEB) network, buses are scheduled to perform timetabled trips while satisfying time, energy consumption, charging, and operational constraints. Increasing research efforts have been dedicated to the integrated optimization of multiple planning tasks to reduce system costs. At a high integration level, this study determines the BEB scheduling and charging planning with flexible charging and timetable shifting strategies. We first formulate an integrated arc-based model to minimize the total costs considering the power grid pressure cost and subsequently reformulate it into a two-stage model, for which we develop an effective solution method. The first stage minimizes the total operational costs including the fleet, charging, and battery degradation costs based on the column generation technique, and the second stage minimizes the peak power demand through two timetable shifting strategies. It is found through numerical experiments that the proposed integrated optimization model and solution method can achieve significant improvement in the utilization rate and reductions in the fleet size, operational costs, and peak power demand compared to the two baseline models.},

abstract = {With large passenger and battery capacity, electric buses (EBs) can play dual roles - commuting tools in transportation networks and mobile energy storage units in power networks. To promote the beneficial synergy between power-transportation coupled networks, it is necessary to properly optimize the operation of EBs in both networks. This article proposes a spatial-temporal scheduling framework for the EB fleet in a power-transportation coupled network. By scheduling the plug-in locations and charging/discharging profiles of the EBs, the model not only minimizes the total operational costs of the fleet (i.e., the electricity consumption and battery degradation costs), but also maximizes the revenue by providing flexibility to the power network. The coupled power and transportation constraints are explicitly described in the model. To address the uncertainty from the fleet's energy consumption, chance-constrained programming is adopted that can be reformulated into second-order cones and efficiently solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method based on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network and the Sioux Falls transportation network.},

abstract = {With the development of electric buses (EBs) in urban areas, how to effectively utilize their charging demand flexibility and the considerable energy stored in the on-board batteries becomes an urgent issue for the electric bus operator (EBO) to consider. This paper focuses on the bidding decision in energy and reserve markets for the urban EBO owning multiple electric bus stations with energy storage systems (ESSs), and the charging scheduling of all EBs. A trip-chain based electric vehicle boundary model is proposed firstly to concisely describe the flexibility region for an EB with multiple sequential trips, which can be further aggregated via a state-based approach to adapt to large-scale problems. The uncertain boundaries are also derived taking the uncertainty of trip energy consumption into account. In order to deal with the issue that the boundary aggregation will possibly influence the feasibility of decomposing the total power to each individual EB, the stochastic bidding and EB scheduling optimization problem in a hierarchical optimization framework is proposed. Accelerated Benders decomposition is utilized to efficiently solve the problem. Case studies verify that the proposed model can dramatically reduce the computational burden, effectively consider the uncertainty and take advantage of the flexibility of both EBs and ESSs to achieve better economic performance.},

Second, the GUE-based coordination model is established for CPTN with PDN generation scheduled and TN traffic assigned simultaneously.

abstract = {Transport accessibility and urban-rural connectivity are seen as critical aspects of rural economic development. In the transit network, passenger flow between urban-rural corridors demonstrates directional imbalances and low utilization of scarce resources. Freight transportation, on the other hand, lags due to poor geography, high operating costs, and scattered demand. This paper proposes a new mode of public transit that integrates passenger and freight transport, providing a carrier for logistics while compensating for the low utilization of passenger transport. In this mode, each timetabled round trip is divided into one dedicated passenger trip with high demand and one mixed-flow trip with on-demand requests. A space-time-state network is constructed considering the picking-up time window, loading/unloading service time, and electric bus energy replenishment. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to optimize the bus schedule that covers the travel demands and the charging requests with minimized travel costs. A Lagrangian relaxation framework with a dynamic programming algorithm and sub-gradient method is presented for problem-solving. The real-life rural-urban transport instance and a simulated network demonstrate the operation of the new mode and validate the efficiency of the proposed method. The innovative concept and the optimization framework are expected to serve as a reference for public administration to alleviate passenger and freight transportation bottlenecks in the urban-rural context.},

This step has gained increased importance with the growing need for sustainable transportation solutions and the widespread adoption of electric buses (EBs) in public transport systems. This study develops a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach for selecting the best EB charging strategy, considering a comprehensive range of criteria, including economic, environmental, social, operational, and quality-of-service criteria. A thorough literature review and a survey of EB experts are conducted to identify key decision-making factors in this area. A Fuzzy Best-Worst Method (FBWM) is designed to determine the weight of criteria, and a Fuzzy Ranking of Alternatives through Functional mapping of criterion subintervals into a Single Interval (FRAFSI) method is designed to rank available charging strategies for EB systems in Munich, Germany. Results show that the most crucial consideration for decision-makers is the economic aspect, followed by operational and environmental factors. The infrastructure cost is the most crucial factor in the economic category, followed by battery cost and operational cost. The driving range is the most crucial factor in the operational category, followed by charging duration and energy monitoring. The experts' assessments indicate a preference for overnight charging over opportunity charging. The results of the FRAFSI are in line with other methods (fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy EDAS). Our findings offer valuable insights and guidance for transportation authorities and decision-makers in charge of selecting charging strategies for EBs.},

The model handles a range of realistic considerations, including heterogeneous BEBs regarding battery capacities, peak net charging power costs, flexible charging powers, and multi-route-multi-depot scheduling. A key point of our model is the introduction of variable charging power decisions designed to align BEB charging demands with solar PV production. The optimization objective is to minimize the sum of charging costs, carbon emission costs, energy storage costs, and revenue (negative cost) from solar PV energy sales. The model empowers public transport agencies to swiftly generate daily BEB charging schedules given daily solar and weather variations.

abstract = {Integrating emerging shared mobility with traditional fixed-line public transport is a promising solution to the mismatch between supply and demand in urban transportation systems. The advent of modular vehicles (MVs) provides opportunities for more flexible and seamless intermodal transit. The MVs, which have been implemented, are comprised of automated modular units (MUs), and can dynamically change the number of MUs comprising them at different times and stops. However, this innovative intermodal urban transit brings with it a new level of dynamism and uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of jointly optimizing the timetable and the vehicle schedule within an intermodal urban transit network utilizing MVs within the context of distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which allows MVs to dynamically (de)couple at each stop and permits flexible circulations of MUs across different transportation modes. We propose a DRO formulation to explore the trade-off between operators and passengers, with the objective of minimizing the worst-case expectation of the weighted sum of passengers' and operating costs. Furthermore, to address the computational intractability of the proposed DRO model, we design a discrepancy-based ambiguity set to reformulate it into a mixed-integer linear programming model. In order to obtain high-quality solutionss of realistic instances, we develop a customized decomposition-based algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The computational results of real-world case studies based on the operational data of Beijing Bus Line illustrate that the proposed integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling method reduces the expected value of passengers' and operating costs by about 6% in comparison with the practical timetable and fixed-capacity vehicles typically used in the Beijing bus system.},

We propose a mixed integer linear program that co-optimizes planning and operational decisions jointly and an iterated local search heuristic to solve large-scale instances. Herein, we use a concurrent scheduler algorithm to generate an initial feasible solution, which serves as a starting point for our iterated local search algorithm. In the sequential case, we first optimize trip assignments and charging locations. Charging schedules are then determined after fixing the optimal decisions from the first level. The joint model, on the other hand, integrates charge scheduling within the local search procedure. The solution quality of the joint and sequential iterated local search models are compared for multiple real-world bus transit networks. Our results demonstrate that joint models can help further improve operating costs by 14.1% and lower total costs by about 4.1% on average compared with sequential models. In addition, energy consumption costs and contracted power capacity costs have been reduced significantly due to our integrated planning approach.},

First, we propose a label-setting dynamic programming algorithm that enables the efficient generation of bus-trips for each bus line in response to passenger requests. Second, we introduce a time–space network optimization model that facilitates integrated multiple bus-trip planning for the transit network, involving multiple bus lines and charging spots. The model selects bus-trips from various time–space arcs, which represent passenger carrying, bus deployment, and bus charging activities. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a case study using real-world data from bus lines in Beijing, China. Computational results demonstrate that our approach can handle on-demand electric bus operations within minutes of solution time, efficiently serving over 2,000 passengers. Practically, our approach achieves a notable reduction in average transit time and effectively reduces the waste of public transit resources.

abstract = {Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data for public transport analyses has received much research interest recently, including its use for the estimation of passenger route choice preferences. However, an important problem persists since AFC data only includes information about the trip within the public transport system, that is stop-to-stop (tap-in to tap-out). Not knowing the full trip from door-to-door might lead to estimation bias, especially when estimating route choice models based on only the chosen stops, which is common practice in current research using AFC data. To avoid this, we propose an improved method for estimating route choice models in public transport using AFC data. The method is based on randomly generating pseudo origin (and destination) points in close vicinity of the actually chosen origin (and destination) stops, thus allowing pseudo access and egress times to be incorporated into the route choice model. The framework is compatible with any probability density function. We suggest using the Beta distribution for generating points when knowledge about access and egress distances are available, whereas the Uniform distribution is suggested when no knowledge is available. The method was applied on replicated AFC data based on traditional travel survey data from the Greater Copenhagen area in Denmark. The results of the model estimations confirm estimation bias in parameter estimates when not correcting for the lack of access/egress information. The proposed method notably improves in-vehicle-time parameter estimates of the route choice model compared to estimation assuming AFC stop-to-stop data, whereas access/egress time and hidden waiting time parameters are still biased, although to a lesser extent than a traditional na{\"{i}}ve estimation based on stop-to-stop data.},

Our model considers a social planner, such that the transit authority and the operator of the electricity system co-optimize the power system to minimize the total operational cost of the grid, while satisfying additional transportation constraints on buses. We provide deterministic and stochastic formulations to co-optimize the system. Each stochastic formulation provides a different set of recourse actions to manage the variable renewable energy uncertainty: ramping up/down of the conventional generators, or charging/discharging of the transit fleet. We demonstrate the capabilities of the model and the benefit obtained via a coordinated strategy. We compare the efficacies of these recourse actions to provide additional managerial insights. We analyze the effect of different pricing strategies on the co-optimization. Noting the stress growing electrified fleets with greater battery capacities will eventually impose on a power network, we provide theoretical insights on coupled investment strategies for expansion planning in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GH) emissions. Given the recent momentum towards building smarter cities and electrifying transit systems, our results provide policy directions towards a sustainable future.

abstract = {In the electric vehicle (EV) routing and overnight charging scheduling problem, a fleet of EVs must serve the demand of a set of customers with time windows. The problem consists in finding a set of minimum cost routes and determining an overnight EV charging schedule that ensures the routes' feasibility. Because (i) travel time and energy consumption are conflicting resources, (ii) the overnight charging operations take considerable time, and (iii) the charging infrastructure at the depot is limited, we model the problem on a multigraph where each arc between two vertices represents a path with a different resource consumption trade-off. To solve the problem, we design a branch-price-and-cut algorithm that implements state-of-the-art techniques, including the ng-path relaxation, subset-row inequalities, and a specialized labeling algorithm. We report computational results showing that the method solves to optimality instances with up to 50 customers. We also present experiments evaluating the benefits of modeling the problem on a multigraph rather than on the more classical 1-graph representation.History: Accepted by Andra Lodi, Area Editor for Design and Analysis of Algorithms—Discrete.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada through the Discovery grants [Grant RGPIN-2023-03791].

@article{Zheng2024,
abstract = {Under the background of urban green and low-carbon economic development, battery electric buses (BEBs) together with fast charging technologies are considered as an effective way in promoting carbon emissions reduction and improving energy efficiency. However, challenges arise during daily peak periods, at which BEB charging activities cause increased operation costs and substantial stress on the power grid. To fill the gaps, this work introduces energy storage systems (ESSs) into the BEB fast-charging scheduling problem. A stochastic programming model considering uncertain discharge efficiencies of ESSs is established, aiming to minimize total operation costs of fast charging stations. It is then transformed into a deterministic one with a manageable scenario sample size, using an integrated sample average approximation (SAA) and K-means approach, as well as an integrated SAA and K-means++ approach. We also present a heuristic algorithm and an improved genetic algorithm to solve the transformed model. Numerical studies based on a real-life urban transit network in Shanghai, China, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Sensitivity analysis further reveals the impact of charging power on total operation cost.},
